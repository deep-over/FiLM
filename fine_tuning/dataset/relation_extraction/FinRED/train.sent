Other sizable civil opportunities that we are tracking for bids further down the road include the $4 billion West Santa Ana Transit Corridor and a $1.5 billion East San Fernando Valley Corridor, both for Los Angeles MTA.
Samsung Electronics will continue to stay abreast of the situation, work to ensure the safety of our employees and deliver high-quality products and services to our customers.
Given the very wide global exposure Samsung Electronics has in terms of its operation, can you share with us your plans of how to respond and contain this risk?
As of end of last year, Samsung Electronics had production sales or R&D sites in 230 countries around the world.
First of all, as you know, Samsung Electronics always tries to maintain flexibility in its operations, which would include inventory, production and investments to reflect the market situation.
We are very attached to manage our software company as software companies because as soon as you go into that software layer of EcoStruxure, on the top of control and products, all of our customers want to have an agnostic view of the situation because of the past, because maybe of different habits in different geographies, they will be using, in the best of cases, Schneider controls and products.
Some examples are Airbnb and Uber in San Francisco and TripAdvisor and Toast in Boston.
And in fact, if you go to the LiveWorx event two years ago, some of you might remember, I was doing a configuration managed augmented reality inspection procedure against the Volvo truck engine.
As compared with our original expectation, the COVID-19 pandemic affected our net sales of fresh and value-added products by an estimated $117 million during the quarter when compared with our original expectation, driven by reduced demand for and price competition in the retail channel.
I'm pleased to say that PayPal just had its strongest quarter since becoming an independent public company 5 years ago.
For instance, we are working with CVS Pharmacy to enable PayPal and Venmo QR codes for payment at their cash registers.
We recently introduced business profiles, a unique new way for consumers and merchants to connect on Venmo and exchange goods and services with the same protections enjoyed by PayPal customers.
We are also expanding functionality beyond omni checkout in both our PayPal and Venmo digital wallets.
What steps are you taking that are going to drive consumer adoption of actually whipping out the PayPal or Venmo wallet at the physical point of sale?
We're going to integrate Honey shopping tools around wish lists, coupons, rewards into our PayPal apps, eventually into our Venmo apps as well, subscription management and other capabilities, other financial services that I won't really go into any detail around today.
The executive search market, although incredibly strategically important to Korn Ferry and an advantage that other people professional services firms do not have, I think that executive search market is probably no more than $5 billion.
So they recently announced an initiative combining LinkedIn Learning, GitHub Learn, Microsoft Learn.
And this particular promotion happened to really, really resonate and was really successful, drove some of the mid-afternoon that particular week that Matt was talking about, but it doesn't change, I think our overall outlook on how we will use marketing moving forward.
We in the toy industry have often pointed out that toy sales hold up relatively well in recessions, and during times of uncertainty, and this has been mostly true.
And given how, given our stronghold in iOS and increasing momentum in the macOS market, we are excited about the opportunities this will create for MobileIron.
So we've seen a few deals trade in Downtown Seattle stuff in North side of the suburban Denver, Complex in Washington D.C. and the Virginia side then a couple of these New York deals that we've been watching, but they haven't closed.
It's obvious, BMW has told us, Mercedes has and Toyota really in Lexus gave us heads up back as we ended going into April that we'd have some tough sledding during the months of July, August and September.
So in addition to consolidation, liability management is certainly a hot topic within the industry today.
Our customer-centric focus has served the company well, but the approach of adding value to customers must evolve and encompass a wider array of drilling and digital technology solutions.
Welcome to the Cameco Corporation Second Quarter 2020 Conference Call.
While it’s good for Cameco to restart Cigar Lake, the restart does not change the fact that there remains tremendous uncertainty about uranium supply as the pandemic continues to cause unplanned supply disruptions added to the planned supply discipline that has already been undertaken.
And maybe just to follow-on from that question, Kazatomprom recently indicated that it may have to buy uranium in the in the spot market due to the production interruptions caused by COVID-19.
I would say that is a bit of a Hollywood problem if Kazatomprom promised to buy and perhaps Uranium has to buy and others that we are never concerned about the price of uranium running up?
As you mentioned already, Russian suspension agreement has been in effect in one form or another since I think 1992 and came out of an anti-dumping action started by U.S. uranium producers back brand Cameco is U.S. uranium mining subsidiaries, power resources in Wyoming and resources in Nebraska, have been active participants in the discussions and negotiations concerning the RSA since auctioned back then, and that continues today.

In an industry that’s only a few years old and has undergone significant change, Aphria has emerged as a clear leader, helping to both define and change the cannabis industry in Canada and abroad.
Our team at Leamington executed well across all our facilities, including Aphria One and Aphria Diamond.
As a result, Aphria continues to drive category leadership and success growth as our revenue from adult-use cannabis grew by 184% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter, they are just great numbers.
The increase was a combined result of the increase in higher margin adult-use sales, the wholesale transaction ratio, and our higher usage of the lower cost cannabis product produced by Aphria versus the sale of cannabis that was purchased through wholesale channels from other LPs in the prior quarter.
Aphria continues to be unmatched on a variety of financial metrics, including our record of consecutive quarters of adjusted positive EBITDA, focus on profitability, operational efficiency and cannabis revenue.
If you come back and look at the cannabis industry today, there’s twice as amount of cannabis sold through the illicit market than just going through stores today.
Then in July, we successfully loaded combination cargoes of NGLs and olefins on the same vessel, including the simultaneous loading of propane and polymer grade propylene into separate compartments on a VLGC at our Houston Ship Channel facility, as well as the simultaneous loading of ethane and ethylene on a vessel at our Morgan’s Port facility.
We have silicon germanium for safety; we had a press release that we serve Denso in Toyota with SiGe for radar.
At Aviation and GECAS many of the drivers we saw in March airlines conserving cash not flying the planes they have limiting maintenance spend and deferring orders are still relevant today.
Notably, we're gaining momentum in India, where we are currently staffing a major new technology center for one of our global financial services clients.
And Shopify plays a more central role in the lives of more than one million merchants on our platform, we need to be the retail operating system, which means we need to make it easy for them to sell anywhere where potential customers may be, whether that's on a place like Pinterest or a social media platform or in a marketplace like Walmart.
And fourth, our strong position and compelling adventure portfolio enables us to continue to develop further multiple high growth market opportunities, all of which adds up to an exciting prospects for Boston Scientific as an innovative, interventional medical device company well positioned and compelling markets due to our minimally invasive approach with important benefits for patients and healthcare systems.
And then given the current status and the announcement that they have made, Japan Post Holdings CEO, Mr. Masuda said, that with this clarity on Japan Post framework for disciplinary action, the Japan Post Group has largely met the five evaluation criteria established by the Japan Post Reform Execution Committee for resuming sales activities.
Given the role we play in culture, we believe Spotify has the responsibility to use our platform to help build a more equitable future.
On the music fronts, we entered a new multi-year global license agreement with Universal Music Group that reflects our shared commitments in growing the industry and supporting artists at all stages of their careers.
She also became the most streamed artist on Spotify on any day this year with nearly 98 million streams on July 24th alone.
So as we talked about before, Spotify is now going after all of audio and that’s obviously a significantly larger market than just the music industry and then on itself.
And obviously, that’s something we are pursuing with creators, but it’s important that we are an open platform and we are seeing more and more contents as I mentioned in my opening statements over 1.5 million shows are now available on Spotify and above 50% of them was created in 2020.
And Spotify has really since its inception played in both of these businesses.
If you are Howard Stern, why would you want to be on Spotify versus Sirius?
So, specifically, to address the question, on our host read ads, the host itself decides among a number of different brands that it wants to work with and then reads those ads in and then Spotify serves that base to the audience that best suits the advertisers intends.
And of course, for Spotify means a higher gross margin business, as well.
Then on the subscriber side, as Japan and the U.S. have shown before, there are existing audio products that are monetizing much higher ARPUs than Spotify in those marketplaces.
The replay of the call will be available on our website and new for the first time also on the Spotify App under Spotify Earnings Call Replays.
This agreement consolidates a range of existing supplier activities that the John Lewis Partnership has and it moves them into a single strategic relationship, and it will ensure that the John Lewis Partnership can benefit from interesting new operational practices and technologies, and that the applications are supported and running to exceeded performance levels.
Some of them are performed by Wizz Air Hungary, but the first 6 new routes of Wizz Air Abu Dhabi are also on the map.
Partly because of the consolidation opportunities we are seeing for the business and partly because Airbus is now able to step up and deliver aircraft orders earlier, and I would say, as originally designed before given that the pressure on their production is falling away resulting from the cancellation [by tourists].
A new Advisory Council is up and running with the strong guidance of former FCC Commissioner and former California Public Utility Commissioner, Rachelle Chong; and former Governor of Delaware, Jack Markell and an impressive group of our employees and consultants.
I would like to welcome everyone to Starbucks Coffee Company’s Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Conference Call.
When taken together, these two points indicate a bright future ahead for all stakeholders of the Starbucks Coffee Company.
In the U.S., Starbucks share of total packaged coffee grew significantly in Q3.
This concludes Starbucks Coffee company’s third quarter fiscal year 2020 conference call.
I’ll provide an update on our innovation, both Mandiant Solutions and FireEye products.
We also created two separate brands, FireEye products and Mandiant Solutions, to better reflect our internal structure.
FireEye products has control technologies to best protect our customers and Mandiant Solutions has a product agnostic offering to enable and empower all security technologies to be as effective as possible.
This event went extremely well and we believe there is significant demand for private cloud among the IBM and Red Hat customer base.
In addition to jointly marketing to these customers, our alliance with Red Hat enables us to bundle OpenShift for any customer that does not already run the platform, and Red Hat OpenShift is merely the start.
And so, that opens up not only many more workload opportunities in our legacy customer base, but also then goes to the IBM and Red Hat customer base, because as you know, we adopted OpenShift is the primary -- is our kubernetes platform.
And that remains very consistent from an IBM and Red Hat customer base as well.
Since we last spoke, Gartner recognized us through their Magic Quadrant for the CRM, customer engagement center and the Magic Quadrant for multi-channel marketing hubs.
FanDuel currently operates in 47 states is the nation's leader in both mobile sports betting and online casino gaming and generate significantly more revenues than its closest competitor.

Where we were more cautious on windows is we said we wanted to support our exhibition partners and clearly on the release you referred to in the last hour indicates AMC is taking a different approach and from what I read in the papers in the recently online, they'll share in some of those revenue streams.
The InfoGenesis, IG Flex, OnDemand, Quick Pay and Buy Kiosk win with La Cantera Hotel in San Antonio, Texas, one of the premier luxury resorts in San Antonio, with 496 rooms and 34 boutique style villas; the OnDemand purchase across four outlets to enable social distancing by a longtime user of InfoGenesis, Hyatt Regency Chesapeake Bay Resort and Spa in Cambridge, Maryland.
In the gig economy food and grocery delivery category, we have seen a nearly 50% growth in transactions from pre-COVID levels and have continued to add new program launches such as Instacart for shopper earnings payouts in Canada.
And during a time when restaurants and in-store bakeries were mostly closed, improved processes at Weston Foods allowed us to quickly adapt production to support increased demand in retail categories, such as fresh bread, all of this while maintaining a no-compromise approach to keeping our people safe and meeting consumers' continued appetite for high-quality baked goods.
Was curious how that's not only the pace of managed payments transferring over, but also what the roadmap looks like in things like seller financing, buy now pay later, things that sellers and buyers had with PayPal that I assume are part of the eBay managed payments over time as well.
Microsoft announced they have added EPYC processors to power their Office Online applications used by more than 200 million monthly users.
Following the expected separation of Upjohn in the fourth quarter of this year, Pfizer will be a more focused, science-driven company that is even better positioned to deliver our innovative medicines and vaccines to patients around the world.
We raised our 2020 total company and new Pfizer guidance ranges for revenues and adjusted diluted EPS, and we reaffirmed all of the components of our financial guidance, including all guidance ranges for our Upjohn business.
So the metrics, facts and figures, you see here, the revenues, one – more than €1 billion, and – more than €2 billion in halved – in the first half of this year compared to the first half of last year.
Our gross debt increased by $567 million versus December 2019, amounting to $4.50 billion as of June 2020 due to Enel Chile new funding with Enel Finance International to finance our renewable CapEx planned and partially offset by Enel Generación Chile debt amortization.
And July is following the same trend of fast recovery, driven by the big success of our new launches, in particular the new PEUGEOT 208, the new Peugeot 2008 and the new Opel Corsa.
What is remarkable is that we are now introducing all the electric versions of the LCV range, starting in 2020 with the Peugeot Expert, the Citroën Jumpy and Opel Vauxhall Vivaro.
So Free2Move mobility services will become a specific tech company, an independent affiliate, 100% affiliate, of PSA but a totally independent company to give the team more autonomy; to give them even more agility, capability to design and to develop software, develop a state-of-the-art software platform for mobility services, making sure that we offer in this platform a full range of services through a unique Free2Move app.
So you see that we have been reasonably fast to bring those products to the market; and now we are entering a pipeline which is very levelized, one new model every year, starting with the Opel Corsa and then now coming the Opel Mokka.
In many industries, from the nuts industry in the north to the other industry in the south, even if you have pockets like Boeing in Seattle creating a hold at the end of the day the total cost is really took up again, if there is a little bit of a demand and visibility.
These risks, uncertainties, and factors include, but are not limited to, the effect of global economic conditions in general and conditions in AudioCodes’ industry and target markets in particular, shifts in supply and demand, market acceptance of new products and the demand for existing products, the impact of competitive products and pricing on AudioCodes and its customers’ products and markets, timely product and technology development upgrades and the ability to manage changes in the market conditions as needed, possible need for additional financing, the ability to satisfy covenants in the company’s loan agreements, possible disruptions from acquisitions, the ability of AudioCodes to successfully integrate the products and operations of acquired companies into AudioCodes’ business, possible adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and results of operations and other factors detailed in AudioCodes’ filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
And that basically tells you and almost doubled quarter-to-quarter, so that tells you that growth of Teams have surpassed the decline of Skype for Business and now they notice we have managed to show growing Microsoft sales, it means that we have -- we are doing the transition from Skype for Business teams in a very determining assured way.
So with regard to create, generate [ph] new opportunities in the Microsoft space, I would like to know that while we saw a dramatic decline in new Skype for Business Opportunities, just like in the revenue side of the business, we saw Teams related opportunities doubling in creation year-over-year.
We have a long standing relationship that have evolved their digital transformation from legacy IP PBX to Skype for Business, and now ultimately moving to Microsoft Teams.
One key new development that's important that I keep talking about our transition to being a communication software company is that we try to increase the software content in every business line that we involve in.
Because in the past, when Microsoft was selling mainly Skype for Business, large companies always took the time to do a pilot, deployed it with several branch offices, and then continued the deployment every quarter in coming years.
Shabtai, you've noted the conflicting dynamics in the Microsoft business with Skype for Business declining and Teams growing quite rapidly.
Over the first half of 2020 we believe Altria showed resilience in volatile conditions, growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by 8.5%, driven by the outstanding financial performance of our core tobacco businesses.
This was further validated last week when Gartner named us as the leader in their 2020 Magic Quadrant for Backup and Recovery Solutions, and Commvault was the first vendor to ever score highest in all three categories of their accompanying Critical Capabilities report; the public cloud, virtual and physical environments.
I was wondering, just given all the new product offerings that you’re unveiling, where are you in terms of educating the channel on some of these new capabilities?
Coming off the Altria earnings call, it -- they suggested also that tobacco consumers broadly were buying in higher volume and that perhaps that was also contributing to higher capital consumption.
Lufthansa has received combined almost €11 billion, even Carsten Spohr has admitted that this is more money than they needed or wanted, but he’s happy to take as much as he can get.
And as Kai noted earlier, Daimler and Volvo have their own JV, just wondering if there's a concern that on this commercial truck hydrogen market, the OEMs might go in-house on some of the components related to hydrogen.
And Michelin is a leader in EV tire and we are present in all the key segments of this market.
The second quarter increase was driven by a decrease in the interest expense due to a combination of lower rates, lower brokered CD balances and a decrease in the impact of the accelerated premium expense associated with calling the remaining brokered certificates of deposits.
We migrated the full mobile base of Telfort’s to KPN in a very smooth way.
Gartner has just ranked us leader in their Magic Quadrant on multi experience development platform and major Q2 deals included L'Oréal and the Australian Department of Defense.
The resistance message I just highlighted will form a cornerstone of our sales and marketing campaign going forward.
Welcome to the Canfor Corporation and Canfor Pulp Second Quarter Analyst Call.
During this call, Canfor Corporation and Canfor Pulp’s Chief Financial Officer will be referring to a slide presentation that is available in the Investor Relations section of the company’s website.
I will make a few comments before I turn things over to Alan Nicholl, our Executive Vice President of Canfor Pulp Operations and our Chief Financial Officer of both Canfor Corporation and Canfor Pulp.

Right now we're seeing flight to quality trend in insurance shoppers particularly in Iberia and LATAM, where MAPFRE has a great name recognition.
So, how do you think the construction industry or Aecon is for second potential wave of COVID-19?
Obviously, there are far more iOS devices out there in the market today than there are Macs.
And you see even as Apple announces things like applications that will run on iOS and the Mac, they don't necessarily announce that these same applications will run on iOS and say, some other manufactured device, which means that you can grow into a scoping and policies for Apple devices that actually encourages the notion of an Apple Enterprise Management system.
iOS has the ability to completely transform workflows through mobility, so completely changing the relationship between teacher and student, changing the relationship between physician and patient, between corporate and retail stores that are out there no longer having a corner where you buy things at but actually make the point of sale at literally the point of sales.
Thanks for pointing out that there was 6 basis points impact to the margin from PPP and running through some of the repricing opportunities on the CD side.
So Mylan is best positioned to make any comments on the Viatris merger.
In most cases, it's cheaper, even fully loaded with commissions and other advertising revenues that they support the channel with.
The toy industry is showing resiliency in these challenging times and Mattel is demonstrating that it is well-positioned to continue its path to long-term profitable growth.
On the retail front, the retail environment obviously remains uncertain but the evolution of our momentum is going to be channeled into our e-commerce platform and while we continue to evaluate our retail footprint, last week we announced three plans to close three doors where leases were actually set to expire in early 2021.
So, you can see, there is such an extraordinary expansion, in addition to Grand Central Station that is weeks away from being conveyed to New York City commuters, straphangers, tourists, everybody, that it really is just something that when the day comes, it'll be quite a moment for the company.
I really think that once the virus is arrested and put behind us, that all of the attributes of New York City and Manhattan proper are still here and are still going to be far and away the most compelling for businesses to want to locate here and people who want to live here 24/7.
Now, once we have this ready, we'll submit the FrontStage product to the new connected contact center for Microsoft Teams Certification program, which means once we complete that process, FrontStage will be officially certified by Microsoft in the top tier of that program.
Red Lobster is still trying to get their arms around some kind of a carry-out or remote delivery capability, which they have never had in the history of the restaurant chain.
Ipsos is the market research organization in the world that uses the most new types of testing.
This quarter, we launched our third-generation Intel Xeon Scalable processor Cooper Lake, which is the first mainstream server CPU bfloat16 support, which increases AI throughput by reducing the amount of data required for the same accuracy.
Leading cloud service providers, including Alibaba, Baidu, Facebook and Tencent, announced they are adopting our third-gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors into their infrastructure and services.
I want to take a moment to recognize Nucor Steel Arkansas and Nucor Castrip Arkansas, for going more than one year without a recordable injury, an impressive accomplishment for one of our larger more complex steel mills.
I'd also like to congratulate Nucor Steel Connecticut for going three years without a recordable injury, congratulations to our teammates at these divisions.
Our culture is the foundation that has made Nucor the preeminent North American steel producer for over 50 years, and we are committed to ensuring that our culture remains the hallmark of our success for the next 50.
In addition, Nucor Steel Berkeley was recognized by GM for excellent quality and responsiveness, and received the Supplier Quality Excellence Award.
And as we start to narrow down the Airbus aircraft that we have we parked all 10 of our A319 last quarter and two of our A320s.
While we saw strength in some of our other items in key markets, such as cocoa powder, syrup and spreads, it wasn’t enough to offset the chocolate declines.
So, of course, as production is starting to ramp up for steel products, they need to import steelmaking coal from the market.
So when you evaluate the copper supply landscape today, you look at Codelco and others in terms of challenges to meet mine production.
At full production, Grasberg mine is the largest gold mine, even though the gold is a byproduct of the copper operations.
I mean, people are talking about a lot of different theories, but we have come up with a way of taking green hydrogen and actually converting it to something that can be transported and delivered to a different station in whether it is in Frankfurt or Tokyo or Shanghai.
Separately, we are also excited to share that our first movie through our relationship with the Hallmark Channel is slated to release this holiday season as a part of the ever popular Hallmark Channel countdown to Christmas.
We also entered into an exciting new partnership with Alipay to further the financial services strategy, which I will talk about towards the end of the call.
In addition, while three ASUR's main airline customers at Mexico, Avianca Holdings and LATAM Airlines Group, recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States.
AutoNation's strong brand, first-class digital capabilities, our One Price strategy combined with lower acquisition costs, stable used vehicle retail pricing, make AutoNation USA stores an attractive investment opportunity.
Regarding our fleet plan, we have reached agreement with Airbus to defer some of our 2020 and 2021 aircraft deliveries and corresponding predelivery deposits.
As Ted mentioned, our cash burn in June included a one-time principal payment of nearly $50 million related to an amendment of our PDP financing facility in conjunction with our Airbus aircraft deferral agreement.
So maybe first a clarification, did your agreement with Airbus to defer aircraft end up resulting in a slightly larger reduction to 2020 CapEx than that $185 million target you called out last quarter?
As far as the fleet, as we announced in April, our fleet simplification plan went into high gear during the quarter as we officially retired the Embraer 190s, Boeing 757s, Boeing 767s, and Airbus A330-300 aircraft as well as a number of regional jets.
In June, the French Government passed the measure with €17 billion in investment on loans to Air France and AIRBUS and other smaller companies in the supply chain.
Since the mid-April forecast that we used for the first quarter provisioning, we have been looking at the assumptions that have a, what I’ll call some sort of a modified Nike swoosh type of recovery to it, which is a recovery that starts at the end of this year, but a recovery that takes a very long period of time to get back to pre-COVID levels.
Covestro developed new polycarbonate grades from post-consumer recycled or in short PCR content such as water bottles, compact disc, and automotive lighting.
Our transformation began with the new operating model we put in place at WarnerMedia last year to organize our teams around entertainment networks, live programming, content production, and affiliate and advertising sales.
That allowed us to work together across WarnerMedia and all of AT&T to successfully launch HBO Max.
A few months ago, we took the next step and moved Xandr to WarnerMedia so we could accelerate our progress in building software-based entertainment platforms supported by both subscription and advertising, like the AVOD version of HBO Max we plan to launch next year.
We’ll talk more about that a little later in the presentation, but I cannot imagine being at this moment absent the moves we made last year to reconfigure our WarnerMedia operations and refocus the business on the growing and important direct-to-consumer opportunity.
The biggest news in the quarter from WarnerMedia was the successful launch of HBO Max, which John will cover in more detail in just a minute.
We finished the quarter with 36.3 million U.S. subscribers to HBO Max and HBO, up from 34.6 million at the end of last year.
It’s our WarnerMedia owned content that’s at the top of the viewing list, and that’s driving the majority of the total hours consumed on the platform.
We’re creating joint SKUs, joint roadmaps and a really comprehensive approach to give our customers a much clearer understanding of Microsoft Technologies and Citrix Technologies together, that roadmap to know how we’re adding value and then the infrastructure to really help them simplify the move to the cloud, make it easy to adopt Citrus Cloud, make it easy to adopt Microsoft Azure and I think that’s going to be a really powerful combination as we go into the next couple of years.
I think as I said it's been this pause I would say has been sort of a refreshing time period for people from working at home to sort of step back and reevaluate things and where we are and what the priorities are and where we're focusing and look at opportunities opportunistically going forward and I think we are seeing the opportunity to look at a lot of those conversion opportunities and we know there's a huge market out there for us to protest to be able to go out and tap in and address that maybe just because for various reasons over the years CSX is ignored or just didn't want to move it or wasn't focused on those opportunities and I think as we are looking to grow and looking for opportunities with a better service product, a lower cost basis which opens up the opportunities for us to play in some markets that traditionally we couldn't before and to price them.
Patrick, one of your bigger brick and mortar retailers it seems as if you're doing a fair amount of business with, it looks like they brought in a smaller competitor on their online channel as well that has Wi-Fi 6 and has attractive pricing.
FedEx for example, uses Dynamics 365 to drive more precise logistics and inventory management.
New account protection and loss prevention features in Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection help protect online revenue, and we are working with financial services firms like Capital One to improve fraud detection and keep customers secure.
Demand for our high value security and voice components drove strong upsell to Office 365 and Microsoft 365 E5.
I actually think the other component, Satya, that I would mention is really the transition we've seen from just Office 365 E5 to Microsoft 365 E5 with the entirety of the value proposition.
Country music streaming is up 13% since the start of the pandemic.
With 1.6 gigawatts of signed PPAs for our Vineyard Wind and Park City projects, AVANGRID is leading the U.S. offshore wind industry by leveraging global offshore experiences from the Ibadrola Group and our European partners.
We're very pleased in the quarter to announce that we, just last week, closed the acquisition of Onanon, Inc. Onanon is based in California and has annual sales of approximately $20 million, and the company designs and manufactures a wide array of high-technology connectors and cable assemblies for customers in the industrial market and with a particular focus on medical related applications.
But I think the fact is is they are a company that is present in next-generation electronics, used in a wide array of applications that are exciting and that are important.
As it relates to Amazon Prime Day, I think we do need to defer to kind of the public statements and news reports around the timing of the Amazon Prime Day.
The COVID crisis has definitely accelerated the trend for larger retail groups to rationalize their store portfolio, concentrating on a smaller number of profitable units in prime locations.
As for our interconnect business, coming into the year, 2020 was already forecasted to be significantly burdened by ongoing issue surrounding Boeing 737 MAX, in addition to lower production of other Boeing and Airbus platforms.
So wouldn't that impact offset a good portion of the savings you would see on the CD book?
And we will continue to develop the road map and execute the road map to be the first steel company globally with a fossil-free steelmaking at the latest 2026.
Does it sound -- it sounds like maybe if you do go past the 180 days, it would cause you to move it to a non-accrual or another status that could have a different risk.
PACCAR is simultaneously developing hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles and has built 10 Kenworth T680s for customers in the Port of Los Angeles.
PACCAR Financial is increasing our retail used truck center capacity worldwide, which enhances margins.
Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 15% premium over the competition.
And then longer-term, if I look at everything that’s happening in Europe with the Green Deal and all of the news in the last couple of days about their push towards hydrogen, I noticed that neither DAF nor PACCAR are a member of the Hydrogen Council or the Hydrogen Initiative in Europe.
What I'm thinking of is not your properties off of Tracy or Exit 8 New York City, but more kind of stuff that you have in, let's say, the Meadowlands in New York City or Bronx.
Our existing steel mills have a fraction of the greenhouse gas emission and energy intensity of average world’s steelmaking technology, less than 15% of the average producer.
We're very pleased to have executed a new 20-year net lease of Loves Furniture to backfill the former Art Van flagship store in Canton, Michigan.

In May, the Annual General Meeting of Uniper confirmed the reorganization of the Supervisory Board with Fortum now having four representatives.
So, now that Uniper is a strategic subsidiary and the fifth segment of the Fortum Group, it is only natural that my number one short-term priority will be to have a joint strategy for the Group in place by the end of the year.
However, we now report Uniper as a separate segment in the Fortum numbers.

This regrouping increased the sales of approximately EUR 4.4 billion in Fortum consolidated income statement compared to the separately Uniper reported numbers.
And sort of related to all of that, if Uniper doesn't want to dispose Unipro then, would that be the main reason you might one day need to go the route of a domination agreement?
And I think you can see that Fortum - both Fortum and Uniper have followed a similar path.
I think generally speaking, Corona has touched us all, so I have to say that first of all, I feel strongly for everyone I mean, every person inside Fortum and Uniper and everyone else who's really had to accommodate to this new situation, children, families, everybody, our elderly family members, so we've all had to stretch.
And in terms of Nordic, you mentioned that Uniper has already created some of the 2022 volume, has Fortum done it also for generation business or not yet because I didn't see any 2022 hedges on your presentation?
So, having said all of this, yes, we are interested, definitely interested in developing our renewables presence actually in our whole operating area, and now also in the enlarged Fortum Uniper Group.
So, first relating to Nord Stream-2 and since this seems to be an important investment by Uniper, but how does Fortum as a parent company assess the situation and should Uniper pull out of the project?

And fourth, we have made advance in our sustainable growth strategy with: on one hand, the unveiling of our ambitious new target as part of our 2030 Vision Commitment to Life; and on the other hand, a number of moves to bolster growth and expand our footprint, including strategic partnerships, such as Singu and VaynerMedia; The Body Shop acquisition of its franchisee business in Japan and move in At Home direct selling in the U.S., which will contribute to long-term top line growth and geographic footprint expansion in strategic markets, such as Asia and North America; and continued advances on the Avon integration, which is so critical for us, with synergies on track.
We want to also develop an Avon brand that is very up-to-date, that is relevant, that has a message that brings again what Avon really stands for.
So what we saw at Avon, the reduction, it is primarily driven by the impact, especially at the beginning, the lockdown, especially in Europe and some markets that are very important for Avon International.
And the reason why we are bullish is we are seeing some of the markets that are seeing, call it, easiness of the lockdown like in the U.K. And we doubled the amount of appointments and recruitment in the last couple of weeks in U.K. You put that and then you added all the digitalization, eBrochures that are now we are making available in many more markets at Avon International, that also creates a possibility to recruit much -- in a much easier way and bring also a different profile of the representatives to Avon International.

Boston Pizza opened no new full service restaurants during the quarter and has opened one new full service restaurant year-to-date.

TOKYO (AP) -- Satoru Iwata, who led Japanese video game company Nintendo Co. through years of growth with its Pokemon and Super Mario franchises, died on the weekend of a bile duct tumor, the company said Monday.

Nintendo pioneered game machines since the 1980s, developing one of the first machines and the hit Game Boy hand-held machine.

Barrick will deliver gold to RGLD Gold in amounts equal to 7.50% of Barrick’s interest in the gold produced at the Pueblo Viejo mine from July 1, 2015 until 990,000 ounces of gold have been delivered, and 3.75% of Barrick’s interest in gold produced thereafter.
It is managed by a joint venture between two of the world’s largest gold producers, with Barrick owning 60% and responsible for operations and Goldcorp Inc. (“Goldcorp”) owning the remaining 40%.
The mine began production in 2013, and is the only primary gold mine in the world with annual production of more than one million ounces of gold (100% basis), at all-in sustaining costs below $700 per ounce.

By Aone Web Media Aug 13, 2015 Uchumi has been in the news since last 6 months for all the wrong reasons, the once famous and reputed brand which enjoyed the goodwill of millions of customers till late April seems to be on a steep unstoppable downhill journey and is in serious financial trouble.Bankers, lenders, vendors and suppliers are all queuing up to collect their dues, in the initial phases it seemed that the Retail Giant of East Africa with 37 outlets was facing some teething trouble with the change in management, but a few delays in payment to suppliers soon became a chronic illness and suddenly all was not well with Uchumi with defaults raising from a month or two going to 6 - 9 months.The situation soon became alarming with suppliers refusing to offer further credit, Bankers refusing to lend, compounding the miseries of Uchumi leading to a huge cash crunch and no working capital, as the promoters, banks and financial institutions refused to bail them out.It was evident that Uchumi needed an immediate capital injection, ironically it was earlier reported widely in the Kenyan media that one of their biggest creditors M/s Quality Group Limited, one of Tanzania's most reputed and respected businesses houses decided to come to the rescue of Uchumi and made an offer to them on 17th of June 2015 offering a 20% premium on that days share value which stood at Kenyan 8.9 Shillings, As the Quality Group was not buying out stakes of a particular share holder but was offering to infuse additional equity into the Company,based on the enhanced equity it is learned that the Quality Group made a written offer of USD 22 Million, which was reportedly turned down by the Management of Uchumi.Interestingly, the highest Share value at the beginning of the year was Kenyan Shillings 14 per Uchumi share which eroded to Kenyan Shillings 8.9 by Mid-June when Quality Group made the offer, since then the Uchumi Management has publically announced that they are selling prime company assets in Kenya to meet the debtors in Kenya & Uganda, they have also announced that they are closing down 7 branches in Uganda & Tanzania all this leading to further loss in the Share Value and shares have been trading between Kenyan Shilling 7.40 to 6.65 in July 15.Financial analysts are working overtime but fail to understand why would Uchumi refuse an offer for capital injection when bankers and existing shareholders are refusing to fund the loss making unit, why would the management of Uchumi disregard a 20 % premium offer on their share whose value is eroding by the day, and why would the management come out in the open acknowledge Financial troubles, announce sales of Assets to meet liabilities, and announce closure of 20 % of its branches immediately which even a lay man would know would erode the Share value, Share Capital, Brand equity further leading to a crash.Our reporter has learned that Uchumi owes The Quality Group in excess of USD 700, 000/- as they are the tenants of Quality Center Mall and seems to have defaulted in rent and utility services.Quality Group that at a stage was to become the rescuer of Uchumi, its brand and thousands of its employees may be left with no alternative but to take the legal route to recover its dues.Is there a deliberate strategy from Uchumi management to crash its own share price and then introduce the HAND OF GOD which will come to their rescue or is it poor management?

If your only information about commodity prices came from coffee sold at Starbucks stores, you might have to conclude that a bull market was underway.
But this year, if your only information about commodity prices came from coffee sold at Starbucks stores, you might have to conclude that a bull market was underway.
Yet on July 6, Starbucks said that its costs were rising and that it was raising the price of much of its brewed coffee by 5¢ to 20¢ a cup.
Why should I be paying more at Starbucks when coffee has been getting cheaper?
Starbucks left its packaged coffee unchanged but decided to extract more revenue in its stores.
In a conference call with investors July 23, Starbucks executives disclosed that they had already locked in the price for more than 80 per cent of coffee supplies for 2016.
Hamish Smith, a commodities economist with Capital Economics in London, said in an interview that a company like Starbucks "can't afford to be in a position where it will run out of coffee or will suddenly have to pay an unexpectedly high price for it".
But when coffee prices drop unexpectedly, as they did this year, these advance strategies can have some negative short-term consequences: It's likely that Starbucks paid more than the current spot market price for coffee stocks, which would be reflected in future financial statements.
That's one reason Starbucks is on a different timetable than the broad coffee markets.
In 1994, when Starbucks opened its Manhattan stores, it charged $US1.25 for a small cup of coffee - known as a "short."

In 1999, Fumiko Kagaya, an employee of Sony Marketing, displayed MS Walkman, Sony's new generation digital Walkman weighing only 69 grams.
After all, Sony seemed to have absolutely everything that a company might need to build a 21st century successor to the Walkman: creative consumer electronics engineers, slick designers, a computing division, expertise with video games, and it owned a music label bursting with famous artists such as Michael Jackson and Vai.
But now Sony was unveiling two different digital Walkman products, each of which used different proprietary technology.
The reason Sony unveiled not one, but two different digital Walkman devices in 1999 was that it was beset with silos: different departments of the giant Sony empire had each developed their own, different digital music devices.
That, in turn, made the products far weaker than anything Sony had produced before: they had none of the dazzle or confidence sense of dominance that the original Walkman had displayed.
It was the same tale in the spring of 2014 when General Motors admitted that some of its compact cars, such as the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, had been fitted with a faulty ignition switch that could flip from the "run" position to the "accessory" position while driving, cutting the engine power and disabling the airbags.
Around the same time that teams at Sony starting exploring ideas about a digital Walkman in 1999, Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple, sat down with a team of engineers to try to create his own digital music experiment.
Within a few months the word "iPod" had not only become a powerful brand in its own right, but defined an entire product category, in much the same way the original Sony Walkman had done.

"Asia's ongoing advancement in the global energy arena is nowhere more evident than this year's CEO of the Year category, where nearly 75% of the Finalists are from the Asia Pacific (APAC)," said Murray Fisher, Platts senior manager of strategic media and head of the Platts Global Energy Awards program.
Not only are these APAC Finalists in the running for the global CEO of the Year Award to be announced in December, but they are also in the running for Asia CEO of the Year , a regional award now in its third year -- the winner of which will be unveiled October 27 at the Platts Top 250 Asia Awards Dinner* in Singapore.
While the U.S. has made a strong showing in this year's Platts Global Energy Awards nominations and Finalists, some 45% of the 2015 Finalists hail from outside the United States.
With the addition of Financial Deal of the Year Award, the Platts Global Energy Awards program for the first time in its 17 years is specifically showcasing performance from private equity, hedge funds and other investment groups and the vital role they are playing amid the energy industry's consolidation and low oil price environment.
Preceding the Awards dinner will be the ninth annual Platts Global Energy Outlook Forum , a platform for exploration and debate of industry-critical issues by energy executives, government officials and academics.
