While it’s good for Cameco to restart Cigar Lake, the restart does not change the fact that there remains tremendous uncertainty about uranium supply as the pandemic continues to cause unplanned supply disruptions added to the planned supply discipline that has already been undertaken. | Cameco ; uranium ; product_or_material_produced
And maybe just to follow-on from that question, Kazatomprom recently indicated that it may have to buy uranium in the in the spot market due to the production interruptions caused by COVID-19. | Kazatomprom ; uranium ; product_or_material_produced
I would say that is a bit of a Hollywood problem if Kazatomprom promised to buy and perhaps Uranium has to buy and others that we are never concerned about the price of uranium running up? | Kazatomprom ; uranium ; product_or_material_produced
As you mentioned already, Russian suspension agreement has been in effect in one form or another since I think 1992 and came out of an anti-dumping action started by U.S. uranium producers back brand Cameco is U.S. uranium mining subsidiaries, power resources in Wyoming and resources in Nebraska, have been active participants in the discussions and negotiations concerning the RSA since auctioned back then, and that continues today. | Cameco ; mining ; industry | Cameco ; uranium ; product_or_material_produced

Our team at Leamington executed well across all our facilities, including Aphria One and Aphria Diamond. | Aphria ; Leamington ; headquarters_location
As a result, Aphria continues to drive category leadership and success growth as our revenue from adult-use cannabis grew by 184% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter, they are just great numbers. | Aphria ; cannabis ; product_or_material_produced
The increase was a combined result of the increase in higher margin adult-use sales, the wholesale transaction ratio, and our higher usage of the lower cost cannabis product produced by Aphria versus the sale of cannabis that was purchased through wholesale channels from other LPs in the prior quarter. | Aphria ; cannabis ; product_or_material_produced
Aphria continues to be unmatched on a variety of financial metrics, including our record of consecutive quarters of adjusted positive EBITDA, focus on profitability, operational efficiency and cannabis revenue. | Aphria ; cannabis ; product_or_material_produced
If you come back and look at the cannabis industry today, there’s twice as amount of cannabis sold through the illicit market than just going through stores today. | cannabis industry ; cannabis ; product_or_material_produced

For the last 12 months, including Q2, the Uniper EPS effect was €0.85 per share including all items and that's out of a Fortum total of €2. | Uniper ; Fortum ; owned_by | Fortum ; Uniper ; owner_of
This regrouping increased the sales of approximately EUR 4.4 billion in Fortum consolidated income statement compared to the separately Uniper reported numbers. | Uniper ; Fortum ; owned_by | Fortum ; Uniper ; owner_of

By Aone Web Media Aug 13, 2015 Uchumi has been in the news since last 6 months for all the wrong reasons, the once famous and reputed brand which enjoyed the goodwill of millions of customers till late April seems to be on a steep unstoppable downhill journey and is in serious financial trouble.Bankers, lenders, vendors and suppliers are all queuing up to collect their dues, in the initial phases it seemed that the Retail Giant of East Africa with 37 outlets was facing some teething trouble with the change in management, but a few delays in payment to suppliers soon became a chronic illness and suddenly all was not well with Uchumi with defaults raising from a month or two going to 6 - 9 months.The situation soon became alarming with suppliers refusing to offer further credit, Bankers refusing to lend, compounding the miseries of Uchumi leading to a huge cash crunch and no working capital, as the promoters, banks and financial institutions refused to bail them out.It was evident that Uchumi needed an immediate capital injection, ironically it was earlier reported widely in the Kenyan media that one of their biggest creditors M/s Quality Group Limited, one of Tanzania's most reputed and respected businesses houses decided to come to the rescue of Uchumi and made an offer to them on 17th of June 2015 offering a 20% premium on that days share value which stood at Kenyan 8.9 Shillings, As the Quality Group was not buying out stakes of a particular share holder but was offering to infuse additional equity into the Company,based on the enhanced equity it is learned that the Quality Group made a written offer of USD 22 Million, which was reportedly turned down by the Management of Uchumi.Interestingly, the highest Share value at the beginning of the year was Kenyan Shillings 14 per Uchumi share which eroded to Kenyan Shillings 8.9 by Mid-June when Quality Group made the offer, since then the Uchumi Management has publically announced that they are selling prime company assets in Kenya to meet the debtors in Kenya & Uganda, they have also announced that they are closing down 7 branches in Uganda & Tanzania all this leading to further loss in the Share Value and shares have been trading between Kenyan Shilling 7.40 to 6.65 in July 15.Financial analysts are working overtime but fail to understand why would Uchumi refuse an offer for capital injection when bankers and existing shareholders are refusing to fund the loss making unit, why would the management of Uchumi disregard a 20 % premium offer on their share whose value is eroding by the day, and why would the management come out in the open acknowledge Financial troubles, announce sales of Assets to meet liabilities, and announce closure of 20 % of its branches immediately which even a lay man would know would erode the Share value, Share Capital, Brand equity further leading to a crash.Our reporter has learned that Uchumi owes The Quality Group in excess of USD 700, 000/- as they are the tenants of Quality Center Mall and seems to have defaulted in rent and utility services.Quality Group that at a stage was to become the rescuer of Uchumi, its brand and thousands of its employees may be left with no alternative but to take the legal route to recover its dues.Is there a deliberate strategy from Uchumi management to crash its own share price and then introduce the HAND OF GOD which will come to their rescue or is it poor management? | Prime ; retail ; industry

After all, Sony seemed to have absolutely everything that a company might need to build a 21st century successor to the Walkman: creative consumer electronics engineers, slick designers, a computing division, expertise with video games, and it owned a music label bursting with famous artists such as Michael Jackson and Vai. | Sony ; consumer electronics ; industry | Sony ; consumer electronics ; product_or_material_produced
But now Sony was unveiling two different digital Walkman products, each of which used different proprietary technology. | Walkman ; Sony ; manufacturer
The reason Sony unveiled not one, but two different digital Walkman devices in 1999 was that it was beset with silos: different departments of the giant Sony empire had each developed their own, different digital music devices. | Walkman ; Sony ; manufacturer
That, in turn, made the products far weaker than anything Sony had produced before: they had none of the dazzle or confidence sense of dominance that the original Walkman had displayed. | Walkman ; Sony ; manufacturer
