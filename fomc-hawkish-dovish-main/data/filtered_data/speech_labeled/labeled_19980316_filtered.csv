75,Another reason for starting with a monetary aggregate strategy is that monetary aggregates played a more significant role in the implementation of monetary policy during Holmes' service as Manager of the System Open Market Account.,LABEL_2,0.9998250603675842
76,"The directive to the Manager from the FOMC during this period was often specified in terms of maintaining or changing ""money market conditions"" (a code for the federal funds rate), unless growth in the monetary aggregates departed significantly from the midpoints of their specified ranges.",LABEL_2,0.9998030066490173
77,This gave money growth a more direct role in the conduct of policy than it has today.,LABEL_2,0.9998155236244202
78,Let's now see why money growth might be a useful target for implementing monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9996368885040283
79,"Economic theory suggests that, if the demand for money is stable, the rate of money growth will pin down the rate of growth in nominal income.",LABEL_2,0.9995678067207336
80,"Under reasonable assumptions, a constant rate of money growth will yield growth of nominal income, on average, at the same rate.",LABEL_2,0.9998168349266052
81,The rate of money growth should be set to achieve a rate of nominal income growth that just equals the rate of trend growth in real output and the rate of inflation consistent with the policy objective.,LABEL_2,0.9919590950012207
82,"On average and in the long run, this rate of money growth will achieve the Fed's inflation objective.",LABEL_2,0.9996445178985596
83,So the first proposition is that a money growth target provides a nominal anchor which pins down the long-run inflation rate.,LABEL_2,0.9997114539146423
84,This strategy immediately allows a translation of the long-run price stability objective into a more near-term money supply growth target.,LABEL_1,0.5586943626403809
85,"And, by implication, any monetary policy strategy must mimic the nominal anchor property of a money supply target, if it is to be consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate for price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9996930360794067
86,"Next, let's ask what would happen if the economy was subject to a shock that moved it away from price stability and full employment.",LABEL_1,0.9434264302253723
87,"If real output increases faster than trend and/or inflation increases relative to the Fed's objective, the resulting higher nominal income growth, relative to the constant rate of money growth, would result in an increase in interest rates.",LABEL_2,0.9957600235939026
88,The second property of a money supply target is that it builds stability into the economy by insuring pro-cyclical movements in the interest rate in response to demand shocks.,LABEL_2,0.9994390606880188
89,Another way of saying this is that it insures that monetary policy automatically leans against the cyclical winds to stabilize the economy.,LABEL_1,0.9995535016059875
90,"The Taylor Rule as a Strategy for an Interest Rate Operating Procedure Despite the desirable properties of a constant money growth rule, in principle, most central banks implement policy by setting short-term interest rates in practice.",LABEL_2,0.9851232171058655
91,"First, instability in money demand reduces the usefulness of money supply targets.",LABEL_2,0.9622183442115784
92,"Second, interest rate targets allow the central bank to smooth out the effects of transitory shocks to financial markets.",LABEL_2,0.9998047947883606
93,"But how should the Fed vary its interest rate ""instrument"" to achieve its ultimate objectives?",LABEL_2,0.9996798038482666
94,The simplest answer is that interest rates should vary to imitate qualitatively the way they would behave if the Fed were implementing a money supply target.,LABEL_2,0.9996649026870728
95,"In other words, interest rates need to be varied systematically to effectively impose a nominal anchor and to insure that policy leans against the cyclical winds.",LABEL_2,0.9996634721755981
96,"Setting monetary policy in this manner via an interest rate target, in principle, allows the Fed to achieve the best of both worlds.",LABEL_2,0.999809205532074

98,"In addition, by careful choice of the degree of response of interest rates to changing economic conditions, the rule can, in principle, improve upon the stabilization properties of a money supply rule.",LABEL_2,0.9998334646224976
99,The appeal of the Taylor Rule is that it is simple and specifies how the federal funds rate (effectively the Fed's instrument) should be varied directly in response to inflation and to deviations of output and inflation from the Fed's ultimate targets of full employment and price stability.,LABEL_2,0.9997970461845398
100,It is useful to appreciate how Taylor derived his rule and how he views its role in monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9997557997703552
101,The Taylor Rule begins by assuming that there is some level of real federal funds rate consistent with full employment and stable inflation.,LABEL_2,0.999572217464447
102,The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate less some measure of inflation expectations (measured by Taylor as actual inflation over the last year)--a measure of the increase in purchasing power (rather than in dollars) associated with holding an asset.,LABEL_2,0.9998427629470825
103,Taylor calls this the equilibrium real interest rate and assumed it was 2%.,LABEL_2,0.9992875456809998
104,Let's assume that the economy is initially at full employment and price stability.,LABEL_2,0.9978945851325989
105,Then the level of real and nominal interest rates would be set at 2%.,LABEL_2,0.9985525012016296
106,"The economy is, of course, not always at full employment and price stability and the purpose of the Taylor Rule is to specify how the federal funds rate should respond to shocks that push the economy away from price stability and/or full employment.",LABEL_2,0.9993639588356018
107,"Because both objectives are explicitly incorporated into the rule, it provides a disciplined approach to juggling the dual mandate for monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9991723299026489
108,The real equilibrium interest rate is viewed as consistent with full employment and any stable rate of inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9972660541534424
109,"So the first implication of this rule is that, in order to be consistent with full employment, nominal interest rates should be adjusted in response to inflation to maintain the equilibrium real interest rate.",LABEL_2,0.9998133778572083
110,The next message of the rule concerns how the real federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to deviations of output and inflation from full employment and price stability.,LABEL_2,0.9993987083435059
111,"According to the rule, when output rises relative to potential output, real interest rates should rise.",LABEL_1,0.9877468347549438
112,"When inflation rises relative to the inflation target, real interest rates should also rise.",LABEL_2,0.9991717338562012
113,These movements of real interest rates in response to departures of inflation and output from their target levels can be shown to stabilize output and inflation relative to their targets.,LABEL_1,0.998688280582428
114,"The Dangers of an Interest Rate Strategy There are natural dangers inherent in interest rate targeting, at least in the absence of a rule that guides its adjustment to changing economic conditions.",LABEL_1,0.999220609664917
115,"If cyclical movements in output are dominated by demand shocks, the failure to move interest rates aggressively enough in response to the shocks can result in monetary policy destabilizing rather than stabilizing the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9993913173675537
116,"For example, if there is a demand shock resulting in higher income and/or prices, the demand for money will increase, putting upward pressure on interest rates.",LABEL_2,0.9997639060020447
117,"If the Fed maintains an unchanged nominal interest rate target, it will have to add reserves to support a higher money supply at the initial interest rate.",LABEL_2,0.8726338148117065
118,"This means that, under a constant interest rate target, a demand shock would lead to perverse monetary policy, specifically to stimulative open market operations, reinforcing rather than damping the demand shock.",LABEL_1,0.9994327425956726
119,The inherent danger in interest rate targeting is reinforced by the preference for central bankers for smoothing interest rates.,LABEL_1,0.9991612434387207
120,"Nevertheless, interest rate targets can, in principle, be implemented in a way that avoids this pitfall, and one of the values of rules is to remind policymakers of the importance of adjusting interest rates in response to changing economic conditions, thereby preventing policy from becoming destabilizing.",LABEL_1,0.9350892305374146
121,Principles to Guide the Setting of Interest Rates We are now ready to identify a set of principles to guide decisions about the setting of the federal funds rate at FOMC meetings.,LABEL_2,0.8699954748153687
122,Underlying these principles are the lessons gleaned from both the constant money growth rule and from the Taylor Rule.,LABEL_2,0.9996803998947144
123,Both rules highlight the importance of imposing a nominal anchor to pin down the long-run inflation rate and of varying real interest rates pro-cyclically to lean against the cyclical winds.,LABEL_2,0.9998229146003723
124,The Taylor Rule also highlights the critical importance of real interest rates in the conduct of monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9998212456703186

127,"That is, under a money growth target, doing nothing (that is, maintaining an unchanged rate of money growth) may not always be the best choice, but, for the most part, it won't get you into serious trouble and will in fact do some considerable good, although it would likely involve a considerable variation in interest rates on a day-to-day basis.",LABEL_2,0.9998213648796082

133,"But to counter the rise in inflation relative to its target, the real interest rate has to rise.",LABEL_1,0.9996827840805054
134,That means that nominal rates have to rise by more than the increase in inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9997729659080505
135,"In the Taylor Rule, for example, the nominal federal funds rate rises by 1.5 percentage points for every one percentage-point increase in inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9994377493858337

147,"The Taylor Rule thus allows for a combination of preemptive policy, changes in interest rates in response to changes in utilization rates, and reactive policy, changes in interest rates in response to movements in inflation itself.",LABEL_2,0.9984996318817139
148,"A still more forward-looking approach would be for policymakers to respond not to actual inflation and utilization rates, as in the Taylor Rule, but to forecasts of projected inflation and utilization rates, assuming an unchanged nominal federal funds rate.",LABEL_2,0.9997088313102722
149,A good reason for responding to forecasts of inflation is that the effects of monetary policy on the economy mostly occur about a year from now.,LABEL_1,0.9995666146278381

161,"The surge in inflation appears to demand a rise in real interest rates, and hence a particularly sharp increase in nominal rates; while the decline in output and employment appears to call for a decline in real interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.9991095662117004
162,"Experience suggests that supply shocks yield a sharp transitory increase in inflation, often followed by a smaller, more permanent effect, though the longer-run effect on inflation will obviously be importantly dictated by the response of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9993601441383362

170,"Another and perhaps better way to respond to supply shocks is to be forward looking and respond to forecasts of future inflation, rather than to the current inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9998052716255188
171,This avoids both an overly aggressive response to the initial burst of overall inflation and an insufficient immediate response because of an inappropriate focus on a measure of inflation that ignores the current rise in oil prices.,LABEL_2,0.9986598491668701
