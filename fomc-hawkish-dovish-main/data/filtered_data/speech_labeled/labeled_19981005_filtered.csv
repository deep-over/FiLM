0,"I focus on the change in the consensus forecast because, in my judgment, it is the revision in the outlook for 1999 in response to recent developments in the global economy and domestic financial markets that justified the recent easing of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9983875751495361
1,Then I will conclude with a discussion of the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.999829888343811
2,"The key here is to explain the rapid change in the posture of monetary policy--from a stance of asymmetric toward tightening just a few months ago, to symmetric, and then to an easing.",LABEL_0,0.6749905943870544
3,Let me emphasize that the views on the economic outlook and monetary policy I present this morning are my own.,LABEL_2,0.9995991587638855
4,"The bottom line is that you forecast a benign slowdown that unwinds some of the tightness in labor markets, while sustaining growth and maintaining modest inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9860370755195618
5,Your forecast also presumes a flexible monetary policy that responds to changing conditions and effectively promotes such an outcome.,LABEL_2,0.9992278814315796
6,"Judging from the path of the Treasury bill rate, the Blue Chip forecast assumed no change in monetary policy through 1999.",LABEL_2,0.9996694326400757
7,"So, the NABE forecast was slightly weaker, but just offset by its assumption of a policy easing, leaving the forecasts for growth over 1999 identical in both cases.",LABEL_2,0.9500864744186401
8,"More likely, it reflects the fact that during this period, there have also been continuing upside surprises with respect to domestic demand.",LABEL_1,0.8714146018028259
9,"As a result, the upward revisions to the forecast for domestic demand may have just offset downward revisions to the forecast for net exports.",LABEL_2,0.9974222183227539
10,"More recently, it also appears to reflect your confidence in monetary policy, a theme that I will return to later.",LABEL_2,0.9998403787612915
11,A soft landing is achieved if growth slows to trend just as the economy converges to potential output.,LABEL_2,0.979136049747467
12,"In this case, growth has to slow to a below-trend rate until actual output again converges to potential, at which point growth returns to and remains at trend.",LABEL_2,0.9985238909721375
13,"The characterization of the forecast as a reverse soft landing hinges on the interpretation that the unemployment rate is initially below NAIRU and that growth slows below trend going forward, allowing the transition back toward NAIRU.",LABEL_0,0.6910566091537476
14,"While this is consistent with your estimates of NAIRU and trend growth, I was, nevertheless, surprised that your estimate of NAURU was as low as it was, 4.9%, and that your estimate of trend growth, 2.7%, was as high as it was.",LABEL_2,0.9990231990814209
15,The qualitative features of the reverse soft landing scenario in your forecast are slowing growth and rising inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9938371777534485
16,"There is a hint of stagflation in your forecast--below-trend growth and rising unemployment, on the one hand, and rising inflation on the other.",LABEL_1,0.9933648109436035
17,"It reflects, I expect, on the inflation side, both the contribution of demand pressures in the labor market, as a consequence of the initial conditions, and dissipation or even reversal of the favorable supply shocks that have been restraining inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9844745397567749
18,"A version that had slower growth and a sharper rise in the unemployment rate, but still well short of a recession, could be consistent, for example, with stable inflation, even beginning from initial conditions of very tight labor markets.",LABEL_0,0.9818395972251892
19,I focus here on the contributions from net exports and private domestic demand.,LABEL_2,0.9930134415626526
20,An external shock lowers net exports and slows GDP growth; the resulting slowdown in GDP growth then weakens domestic demand.,LABEL_2,0.9998049139976501
21,"Even though the decline in net exports was much sharper than virtually anyone expected, subtracting more than 2 percentage points from growth, the economy's average growth did not differ much from the pace over the previous year.",LABEL_0,0.9346354007720947
22,"The growth in the first half was, to be sure, unbalanced between the first and second quarters, but that was entirely due to the rise in inventory investment in the first quarter and its decline in the second.",LABEL_0,0.9940932393074036
23,The strength of domestic demand and the subtraction via net exports were very similar in both quarters.,LABEL_2,0.5121808648109436
24,The explanation for the stability of GDP growth was the surprising surge of private domestic demand that offset the sharper-than-expected decline in net exports.,LABEL_2,0.9986801743507385
25,"Private domestic demand soared to an 8% annual rate in the first half, from the robust 4 Â½% rate over the previous two years.",LABEL_2,0.9971634745597839
26,This raises two questions: Why did private demand soar in the first half and why will the economy slow going forward?,LABEL_1,0.5100626349449158
27,"To be sure, recent developments have reinforced the negative outlook for the external sector and net exports will be subtracting from GDP growth going forward.",LABEL_1,0.9759712815284729
28,"But in the consensus forecast, net exports subtract less than half as much from GDP growth in the second half as in the first half and still less in 1999.",LABEL_2,0.9739149212837219
29,"Hence, the slowdown scenario now depends critically on a slowing in domestic demand.",LABEL_0,0.9978039860725403
30,"So while all eyes are focused on global turmoil and the spillover to U.S. net exports, I believe that you are correct to focus the case for slowdown ahead on diminished strength in private domestic demand.",LABEL_2,0.9996009469032288
31,"There are three key developments that, in my view, justify a downward revision for the forecast for growth in 1999.",LABEL_0,0.9471217393875122
32,"First, the further pressure on emerging market economies, especially Latin America, following the Russian default and devaluation merits a downward revision in the forecast for foreign growth and hence in U.S. net exports.",LABEL_0,0.9975395202636719
33,"Second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.",LABEL_0,0.9986032843589783
34,Phase one resulted in a powerful adverse shock to U.S. aggregate demand as a result of the decline in net exports induced by the combination of recessions and sharp depreciations in the region.,LABEL_0,0.9988803267478943
35,"But the same global turmoil that undermined net exports also brought a shift in portfolio preferences toward dollar-denominated assets, resulting in lower interest rates and perhaps adding to the resilience of U.S. equity markets.",LABEL_0,0.9978812336921692
36,"In addition, an important part of the decline in oil prices could be directly attributable to the regional turmoil, taking into account both the declines in income and the dramatic increase in the relative price of oil, priced in dollars, to this region.",LABEL_0,0.9991337656974792
37,"The latter two developments buoyed U.S. private domestic demand, contributing at least in part to its strengthening during the first half and partially offsetting the restraint via net exports.",LABEL_0,0.9983177185058594
38,"There has been a sharp correction of equity prices, in the United States and around the world, and rising risk spreads offset and, for the riskier borrowers, more than offset the effect of further declines in government bond rates.",LABEL_0,0.998454213142395
39,So phase two has added to the projected decline in net exports ahead and broadened the impact of global turmoil on domestic demand by undermining the favorable set of financial conditions that had been so important in promoting strong growth over the last couple of years.,LABEL_2,0.784568190574646
40,"Phase one failed to slow GDP growth, in part, because of offsets via lower interest rates and a lower price of oil.",LABEL_1,0.9855687022209167
41,"They do not, I believe, fully explain the surge in domestic demand in the first half.",LABEL_0,0.9979497790336609
42,Part of this surge may have reflected the lagged effects of the long period of rising equity prices and declining long-term rates.,LABEL_0,0.9098933339118958
43,But part may simply have been an unexplained and fortuitous positive demand surprise.,LABEL_2,0.5540569424629211
44,"In this case, the slowdown going forward will be reinforced to the extent these positive demand shocks dissipate.",LABEL_0,0.9976420998573303
45,"Growth is going to slow, in part, because it was unexplainably high in the first half.",LABEL_2,0.9908128380775452
46,It reminds me of the explanation of our forecast at LHM&A for a sharp decline in long-term interest rates in 1993.,LABEL_0,0.9942529797554016
47,"The slowdown in 1999 will be the cumulative effect of this spontaneous slowing as the high-flying economy succumbs to the force of gravity and the induced slowing of the economy in response to weaker foreign growth, the recent decline in equity values, and the widening of risk spreads and generally reduced appetite for risk.",LABEL_2,0.6143348813056946
48,A source of such discontinuity arises from possible devaluations in countries on a fixed or pegged exchange rate.,LABEL_2,0.5219935774803162
49,"Whereas under floating rates, a gradual depreciation could take some pressure off an economy subject to an adverse shock, a forced devaluation in a country that can no longer defend its peg often reinforces rather than cushions the downward momentum in the economy in response to an adverse shock and can, therefore, be instrumental in abruptly moving an economy from slow growth to sharp recession.",LABEL_0,0.9895787835121155
50,"They can be aggressive with the central tendency forecast and project a substantial slowing in growth, leaving us with about equal probabilities that growth will be faster or slower than the central tendency.",LABEL_2,0.9995914101600647
51,"Both the central tendency and the perception of the probability distribution around that central tendency are important features of the ""outlook"" and are relevant to the setting of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9511690139770508
52,"Interestingly, as I have noted before, this is not a period over which there has been a slowdown in GDP growth.",LABEL_0,0.9768908619880676
53,The margin squeeze reflects the effect of tight labor markets on wages and the deceleration in product prices over the last several quarters.,LABEL_2,0.9998263716697693
54,One of the most dramatic developments over the last year has been a halving in the inflation rate for broad indices of domestically produced goods.,LABEL_0,0.6778725385665894
55,"For example, the chain price measure for GDP has slowed from 2% over the four quarters ended in the second quarter of 1997 to just 1% over the four quarters ended in the second quarter of 1998.",LABEL_1,0.982029139995575
56,A couple of tenths of this slowdown can be attributed to developments in food and especially energy prices.,LABEL_0,0.7718906402587891
57,"A key factor, I believe, was the increasingly rapid decline in import prices.",LABEL_2,0.9929185509681702
58,"Nevertheless, I believe that the effect of declining import prices might have been as large or even larger on the GDP price measure than on the CPI or PCE price indices that directly include imports.",LABEL_2,0.9142090082168579
59,One of the most important sources of restraint on inflation in this episode has been the effect of declining import prices on the pricing leverage of domestic producers of competing goods.,LABEL_1,0.9133467674255371
60,"Given the tightness of labor markets, it has been widely expected that profit margins would narrow as the mark-up of prices over unit labor costs declined.",LABEL_2,0.9702020883560181
61,This was expected to result from a gradual acceleration of wages relative to prices and to be a precursor of higher price inflation.,LABEL_0,0.9589757919311523
62,"The mark-up has indeed declined, but more from a deceleration of prices relative to wages.",LABEL_1,0.9862343072891235
63,"Instead of pointing toward higher inflation, the decline in the mark-up is in fact further evidence of forces restraining inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9899986386299133
64,"Going forward, slower growth is likely to bring a cyclical slowing in productivity, reinforcing the effect of narrower margins on profits.",LABEL_1,0.7605958580970764
65,The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy Now I turn to the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.5811649560928345
66,Two-sided risks The first challenge facing monetary policy is the degree of two-sided risk the economy faces.,LABEL_0,0.9964442849159241
67,"The upside risk, the threat of higher inflation, arises from the initial conditions and from the history of growth exceeding expectations over the past two years.",LABEL_2,0.9997796416282654
68,"This set of initial conditions is clearly not one that supports, much less compels an easing in monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9997066855430603
69,"The downside risk became noteworthy following the crises among Asian developing economies and Japan slipping from stagnation into recession and, more recently was exacerbated by the further contagion among emerging market economies, and the decline in equity prices and increased risk spreads here at home.",LABEL_1,0.9994646906852722
70,"By late September, this balance had shifted enough, in my view, to justify an easing of monetary policy.",LABEL_1,0.5156463384628296
71,"Asymmetric risk and the ""maximin"" solution The adjustment to the outlook that justified the policy change can be thought of as some combination of a lower central tendency for growth next year and a widening of the risk associated with downside possibilities relative to the baseline forecast.",LABEL_0,0.9970355033874512
72,"For example, if there is no change in policy, the worse case outcome would be a sharp slowing in growth to well below the trend rate.",LABEL_0,0.9877199530601501
73,"Under an easing, the worse case outcome would be that the economy turned out stronger than expected, so the easing was unwarranted, and inflation increased more sharply than projected.",LABEL_0,0.9987183809280396
74,"My judgment is that the most worrisome possibility has become the former, justifying the easing of monetary policy last week.",LABEL_0,0.994273841381073
75,"During the period when the stance of monetary policy was asymmetric toward tightening, the focus was on whether or not a preemptive move toward restraint was justified in light of the progressive tightening of the labor market.",LABEL_1,0.9995618462562561
76,"Because inflation continued to decline, even as labor markets became tighter, and because the turmoil in global markets held the possibility of some relief in U.S. labor markets, policy remained on hold, with the exception of the single 25-basis point tightening in March of 1997.",LABEL_0,0.9655492901802063
77,"If labor markets initially are very tight, growth has been above trend, and there have been consistent surprises on the up side, there will be more caution in easing than if the economy were initially operating just at full employment and growing at trend.",LABEL_1,0.9993564486503601
78,The Taylor Rule and balancing stabilization and inflation objectives I have talked on several occasions about the usefulness of the Taylor Rule as a starting point for thinking about monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.4850364327430725
79,"The Taylor Rule specifies how the federal funds rate should be adjusted over time in response to changing economic conditions, allowing attention to be paid to monetary policy's stabilization role in the context of the Federal Reserve's long-run price stability objective.",LABEL_1,0.9874305725097656
80,"There are a variety of versions of this basic approach, depending on measures of utilization and inflation rates and depending on whether the adjustment is made in response to past and current movements in utilization and inflation rates or in response to forecasts of these variables.",LABEL_2,0.9998413324356079
81,"I believe the current move can be justified in a forward-looking variant of the Taylor Rule, where today's policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9992325305938721
82,"The policy is, therefore, well designed, in my judgment, to balance the stabilization and inflation objectives.",LABEL_2,0.9997996687889099
83,"That is, a U.S. economy growing at its maximum sustainable rate, at its maximum sustainable utilization rate, and maintaining price stability would offer the very best support that we could possibly provide to the world economy.",LABEL_2,0.9993534684181213
84,Our Congressional mandate is to achieve full employment and price stability in the United States.,LABEL_2,0.9967764019966125
85,"It should be appreciated, however, that U.S. monetary policy has a far greater ability to shield the U.S. economy from global distress than to counter the powerful recessionary and deflationary forces in the world economy.",LABEL_1,0.8952858448028564
86,"The stock market and monetary policy Just a short time ago, there was widespread concern that an overvalued stock market, an erosion of credit standards and failure to adequately reflect risk in asset prices were both contributing to the strength of the expansion and increasing the vulnerability of the economy.",LABEL_1,0.9971612691879272
87,"The conventional wisdom for monetary policy, nevertheless, was not to assume that policymakers had a better ability to assess stock market valuations than market participants themselves.",LABEL_0,0.9990110397338867
88,"The stock market, in this view, should be taken into account in monetary policy in the same way as myriad other considerations, only in so far as it affected the balance between supply and demand in the economy and hence projected macroeconomic performance.",LABEL_1,0.993439257144928
89,"The simulative effect of soaring equity prices was one of the considerations that, in my judgment, supported allowing the real federal funds rate to rise, as inflation declined over recent quarters.",LABEL_2,0.9998288154602051
90,"Now that stock prices have moved lower and there has been some reversal of the excessive erosion in risk premiums, it would be wildly inconsistent to argue that these market developments themselves are the basis for easier monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9998483657836914
91,"Once again, the issue is the effect of recent market developments on the forecast for growth, utilization rates and inflation and whether any such revision is sufficient to justify policy action.",LABEL_1,0.9803457856178284
92,Conclusion The U.S. economy continues to operate at high utilization rates and with low inflation.,LABEL_0,0.9773264527320862
93,But the cumulative force of recent developments appears likely to yield a slowing in the pace of growth next year.,LABEL_2,0.9997902512550354
94,"Fortunately, monetary policy is capable of responding quickly to changing conditions.",LABEL_1,0.9289408326148987
95,"The role of monetary policy, in this episode, is to cushion this slowdown, provide insurance against downside risks, and promote the reverse soft landing you have been consistently forecasting.",LABEL_0,0.9979214072227478
96,"Your forecast, in particular, and consensus forecasts, in general, appear to appreciate both the ability and willingness of monetary policy to adjust as necessary to changing developments.",LABEL_2,0.9997071623802185
97,"This perception is, I believe, one reason why consensus forecasts have changed so little in the face of recent developments that appeared to encourage downward revisions to the forecast for growth.",LABEL_1,0.9487389922142029
98,"MA's consensus panel projected that GDP growth would be 2.1% over 1999, almost identical to your forecast.",LABEL_2,0.9992891550064087
99,"This seems to further confirm that some things, like the growth forecast for 1999, apparently never change.",LABEL_2,0.8963268995285034
