2,"May 26, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles At the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, David, and thank you to Brookings and the Hutchins Center for the opportunity to lead things off and be part of this very distinguished panel.",LABEL_2,0.9998089671134949
3,"Today, I will explain why I expect the U.S. economy to continue growing strongly over the remainder of this year and what the implications of that outlook are for monetary policy.1 After the shutdowns and other measures taken in response to the COVID-19 outbreak last spring caused the swiftest and deepest recession in U.S. history, the economy has made a powerful recovery.",LABEL_0,0.8720298409461975
4,"Households and businesses adapted, supported by the flexibility and inherent strength of our market-based economy, by the continued resilience of our banking system, and by significant fiscal and monetary policy support.",LABEL_0,0.9967302083969116
5,"Highly accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve has fostered strong growth in interest rateâ€“sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and durable goods, offsetting some of the historic weakness in the service sector last year.",LABEL_0,0.9891836643218994
6,"With the service sector reopening while other household and business spending remains strong, I expect rapid growth to continue for some time before slowing to a still robust pace next year.",LABEL_1,0.9613960385322571
7,"Inflation is running significantly above the Federal Reserve's longer-run goal of 2 percent primarily as a result of three factors: the surge in demand as more services come back on line while goods spending remains robust, the emergence of bottlenecks in some supply chains, and the very low inflation readings recorded last spring dropping out of the calculation of 12-month inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9951453804969788
8,"For reasons I will detail in a moment, I expect that a significant portion of that recent boost to inflation will be transitory, and that it will not interfere with the rapid growth driving progress toward the Fed's maximum-employment goal.",LABEL_1,0.9944743514060974
9,"The progress in reopening has been slower in countries that are among our largest trading partners, weighing on U.S. growth by reducing demand for U.S. exports.",LABEL_2,0.9143450856208801
10,"First, I see increasing recognition by the private and public sectors that a broad reopening can proceed safely.i The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped most social-distancing recommendations for vaccinated people.2 Although local COVID-19 restrictions on schooling and economic activity continue in some areas, most schools are teaching in person at least part time and more than half of states have dropped all capacity constraints on restaurants, bars, and retail establishments.",LABEL_0,0.9885388016700745
11,"Again, a lot of that reflected the most recent round of stimulus payments, but as employment grows and people return to normal life and work, the accumulated stock of savings will support spending for many months to come.",LABEL_2,0.9980788230895996
12,"Strong U.S. demand is boosting imports, but weaker demand outside the United States, where recovery is slower, is restraining exports, and that problem may not resolve for some time.",LABEL_0,0.9986932873725891
13,"Supply bottlenecks are more prevalent now, especially in the auto and housing industries, with shortages of inputs leading to slower production that reduces employment growth.",LABEL_1,0.9981359243392944
14,"Although I expect employment to rise significantly in coming months, the picture is more mixed for the labor market than it is for spending.",LABEL_0,0.9817737936973572
15,"The unemployment rate remains at 6.1 percent, compared with 3.5 percent pre-COVID-19, and there are 8 million fewer jobs.",LABEL_0,0.9354825019836426
16,"Despite recent gains amid reopenings, employment in the travel, leisure, and food services sectors remains well below pre-pandemic levels.",LABEL_2,0.9968549013137817
17,"My optimism here reflects the apparent recovery in overall labor demandâ€”by many metrics, job openings are above 2019 levels, including for workers without a college degree, a group especially affected last year.",LABEL_0,0.9458379149436951
18,"In the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data for March, private-sector job openings as a percentage of total employment increased to 5.6 percent, which is above the previous record for that series set in November 2018.",LABEL_0,0.995796799659729
19,"Job growth of 266,000 in April was a disappointing slowdown from recent months, but good news lurked beneath the headlines: For those who were working, average hours increased; the number of people working part time because they couldn't find full-time jobs decreased significantly; and wage growth was very strong.",LABEL_1,0.8895251154899597
20,"And, although the evidence is mixed, we have received plenty of anecdotal reports about the influence of generous unemployment benefits and large cash payments on the willingness of workers to return to work.",LABEL_1,0.9602257609367371
21,"Now let's turn to the other half of the Federal Reserve's economic goals, inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9809041619300842
22,"As I mentioned last week during congressional testimony, I agree with the widespread view among my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and most private forecasters that the recent rise in inflation to well above 2 percent is driven by temporary factors.",LABEL_0,0.881915271282196
23,I expect inflation to begin subsiding at some point over the next several months and to be running close to 2 percent again at some point during 2022.,LABEL_2,0.999698281288147
24,"Market-implied inflation expectations have risen only to the levels that prevailed in the early 2010s, after which inflation never ran consistently above 2 percent, and most survey measures are sending similar signals.",LABEL_1,0.9985866546630859
25,"Therefore, I consider these recent increases in inflation expectations a welcome development, reversing the large declines seen last spring and perhaps edging up in response to the message in the FOMC's new policy framework.",LABEL_2,0.9962761402130127
26,"That said, my optimistic outlook for growth and employment places me among those who see the risks to inflation over the medium term as weighted to the upside, relative to my baseline forecast.",LABEL_2,0.9966367483139038
27,"A moment ago, I celebrated the upturn in wages in April, but it may be a sign that the torrid growth of the economy and labor supply shortages have begun pushing up wages faster than occurred with the moderate economic growth over much of the past decade.",LABEL_1,0.9995599389076233
28,Wages are a large component of business costs that could pass through to prices more readily than increases in the cost of other inputs.,LABEL_1,0.9988738894462585
29,"It seems like a paradox that there could be labor supply problems and wage pressures at 6 percent unemployment, but it is also a fact.",LABEL_1,0.9996125102043152
30,It is reasonable to ask if the strength of spending stemming from this unprecedented fiscal stimulus will put significant upward pressure on inflation as households and businesses emerge further from the COVID event.,LABEL_1,0.928019642829895
31,"But, at least to date, the latest round of stimulus seems to be supporting spending and growth without causing an inordinate rise in interest rates or inflation expectations.",LABEL_1,0.9967727065086365
32,"That outcome aligns with the advice of those in the economics profession who have produced research in recent years that leaves them much more comfortable with high deficits and debt, at least in countries with low interest rates, than they used to be.4 In 2006, when I was serving as Under Secretary of the Treasury, we were subject to harsh criticism for running a deficit of not quite $250 billion, with total debt held by the public at 35 percent of GDP.5 By contrast, in 2021, the deficit is currently projected to be $3.4 trillion, and total debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2020 was 100 percent of GDP.6 Further fiscal policy actions are, of course, the purview of the Congress and the Administration.",LABEL_1,0.9221394658088684
33,Surely the deficits being run to offset the COVID-related shocks have made it even more critical to address the sustainability of government debt in the years ahead.,LABEL_1,0.9297187924385071
34,"And, finally, recent monthly readings on import prices, producer prices, and consumer prices have all come in above consensus expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9137062430381775
35,"It is true that many of the factors driving the April consumer price index report and other inflation surprises continue to be supply bottlenecks, and it is reasonable to conclude that these will ease over time.",LABEL_1,0.994955837726593
36,"If these shortages persist into 2022, people may adjust their expectations higher for future inflation, which could make above-target inflation more persistent than we currently expect.",LABEL_1,0.9914796352386475
37,"We designed our new monetary policy framework for the very different world we live in now, which involves an equilibrium for the economy with slow workforce growth, lower potential growth, lower underlying inflation, and, therefore, lower interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.9985750913619995
38,"One of those differences is that the kinds of ""wage-price spirals"" that characterized inflation dynamics in the 1970s have not been present for a long time.",LABEL_1,0.9993144273757935
39,It's quite possible that this situation now prevails because inflation is never high enough for long enough to enter decisionmaking in a material way.,LABEL_0,0.9476810097694397
40,"So, what are the implications for monetary policy?",LABEL_2,0.9897027611732483
41,I am fully committed to the FOMC's new monetary policy framework and the two pieces of related guidance that we have put in place for asset purchases and the federal funds rate to implement that framework.,LABEL_2,0.9997218251228333
42,"The guidance on asset purchases, introduced in December, commits us to increasing our holdings of securities at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",LABEL_2,0.9998071789741516
43,"My personal view is that the rise in inflationâ€”even after discounting temporary factorsâ€”and inflation expectations since December will prove sufficient to satisfy the standard for inflation in the guidance around asset purchases later this year, but improvement in the labor market has been slower than I would have liked.",LABEL_2,0.9995276927947998
44,"For instance, the unemployment rate has decreased only 0.6 percentage points to 6.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate is still nearly the same as it was at the time of the December meeting.",LABEL_0,0.9981095790863037
45,"Therefore, we need to remain patient in the face of what seem to be transitory shocks to prices and wages so long as inflation expectations continue to fluctuate around levels that are consistent with our longer-run inflation goal.",LABEL_1,0.9994588494300842
46,The best analysis we currently have is that the rise in inflation to well above our target will be temporary.,LABEL_2,0.9967842102050781
47,"Part of the calculus in balancing the risks of either overshooting or undershooting our 2 percent goal is that the Fed has the tools to address inflation that runs too high, while it is more difficult to raise inflation that falls below target.",LABEL_2,0.9991717338562012
48,"If we're wrong, we know how to bring inflation down.",LABEL_1,0.9990459084510803
49,"But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is that we are not far behind.",LABEL_2,0.675787091255188
50,"If my expectations about economic growth, employment, and inflation over the coming months are borne out, however, and especially if they come in stronger than I expect, then, as noted in the minutes of the last FOMC meeting, it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.",LABEL_0,0.8601067066192627
51,"In particular, we may need additional public communications about the conditions that constitute substantial further progress since December toward our broad and inclusive definition of maximum employment.",LABEL_1,0.9765947461128235
52,"This standard presents inherent communications challenges because it cannot be summarized by a single labor market indicator, such as the unemployment rate thresholds used in the Committee's interest rate forward guidance between late 2012 and late 2013.",LABEL_0,0.9974291920661926
53,"In contrast, the time for discussing a change in the federal funds rate remains in the future.i The guidance for the federal funds rate commits to maintain the current rate until labor market conditions are consistent with our goal of maximum employment and inflation not only has reached 2 percent, but also is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",LABEL_1,0.9996337890625
54,"In the FOMC's most recent Summary of Economic Projections, no participantsâ€”even those with optimistic growth forecasts such as I've outlined todayâ€”thought it appropriate that liftoff occur before 2022.",LABEL_0,0.9962770342826843
55,"Thus, I expect that monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for some time.",LABEL_2,0.9997368454933167
56,"As the Fed's most recent Financial Stability Report notes, the bright outlook, ample supply of credit, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy have pushed some asset valuations to very high levels that could be subject to sharp reversals if expectations are not met.",LABEL_2,0.8761171698570251
57,"Banks met extraordinary demands for credit last spring from nonfinancial businesses and households while simultaneously providing forbearance on millions of existing loans and building substantial loss reserves, all without significant strains to their overall health.",LABEL_2,0.9973378777503967
58,"Household credit is primarily owed by borrowers with prime credit scores, rising home prices have most homeowners flush with equity, and, as I noted earlier, households are sitting on a large stock of savings.",LABEL_0,0.998001754283905
59,"It is true that there are structural vulnerabilities in the nonbank financial sector, particularly money funds and hedge funds, and these are being scrutinized by U.S. and international authorities, including the Financial Stability Board under my chairmanship.7 But I believe these risks are manageable, and I come down on the side of the research that concludes these and other concerns are best addressed by targeted financial regulation and supervision rather than the blunt tool of monetary policy.8 At a crucial moment in our recovery from the COVID-19 event, the utility of using monetary policy to try to address financial stability concerns would be greatly outweighed by the costs to employment and growth.",LABEL_1,0.7395720481872559
60,"While prices will run above our 2 percent target this year, I believe most of this increase will be transitory.",LABEL_2,0.6636881232261658
