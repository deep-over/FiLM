9,"If we did our job poorly and tolerated significant deviations from price stability and fluctuations in aggregate income and output, we would only add to the difficulties workers and businesses face in discerning the correct signals from evolving relative prices and in making the resultant necessary and beneficial adjustments in resource allocation.",LABEL_2,0.9993358254432678
10,"Exchange rates for the dollar with respect to major currencies were fixed in a system in which the United States enjoyed the ""exorbitant privilege"" of being the reserve currency.",LABEL_2,0.999729335308075
11,"In effect, the United States was the ""nth"" country in the global economic system, meaning that U.S. economic preeminence implied that policy--including monetary policy--could be set essentially independently of the global economy; our trading partners would have to react to the downstream consequences of U.S. developments.",LABEL_2,0.999082088470459
12,"The recovery of our trading partners from World War II, the development of more-sophisticated financial markets, the growth of trade, and the desires of other countries to pursue policies independent from those of the United States strained to the breaking point the exchange rate system put in place at the end of the war.",LABEL_2,0.9987851977348328
13,"In the early 1970s, we shifted from fixed exchange rates under the Bretton Woods system to the present arrangements, in which the dollar's value against major currencies is set by market forces.",LABEL_2,0.9997634291648865

16,"For example, a change in domestic demand should have a smaller effect on gross domestic product, employment, and prices in an open economy than in a closed one because some of its effect will fall on imports--through changes in income or the dollar's exchange rate, or both.",LABEL_2,0.9997689127922058
17,Perhaps the most consequential development for monetary policy was the shift to more-flexible exchange rates.,LABEL_2,0.9892576336860657
18,This shift both lifted the constraint of defending the exchange rate and strengthened the effect of policy actions.,LABEL_2,0.9998204112052917
19,"According to the textbooks, when exchange rates can move, easier monetary policy--lower interest rates--should stimulate demand by depreciating the currency and boosting net exports as well as by reducing the cost of borrowing domestically.",LABEL_0,0.7665037512779236
20,"Similarly, tighter policy should restrain demand and hold down prices through an appreciation of the currency in addition to raising interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.9847972989082336
21,"Admittedly, the exchange rate channel does not always work this way in practice; among other things, exchange rates also depend on trade and current account balances and on what is happening in the economies of our trading partners; and currency values respond more to the expected pattern of interest rates here and abroad than to the current short-term rates that central banks control.",LABEL_2,0.9997715353965759
22,"These factors mean that the exchange rate sometimes moves in surprising directions, complicating monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9996790885925293
23,"Furthermore, the exchange rate channel can amplify the effects of mistaken policies--for example, the dollar may fall and add to domestic inflation pressures if the stance of policy is overly accommodative.",LABEL_2,0.9998202919960022
24,"It took central banks some time to learn to operate successfully without the anchor of a fixed exchange rate, and partly for this reason inflation soared in the 1970s while economic activity stagnated.",LABEL_2,0.999768078327179
25,"As central banks and governments came to recognize the critical importance of long-term price stability, inflation subsequently subsided.",LABEL_1,0.9931679368019104
26,"The fall in inflation coincided with a step-up in the pace of global economic integration, including in the past decade or more the increasing involvement of those economies in Asia and elsewhere.",LABEL_1,0.9595819711685181
27,"The question is whether that development has affected overall inflation and employment in industrial countries, and thus whether it may have changed the setting of monetary policy needed to maintain price stability and sustained high employment.",LABEL_2,0.9761883616447449
28,The Implications for Inflation I have been struck recently by the contrast between the views reported in the media and views among academic economists on this issue of globalization and inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9878760576248169

31,"One modeler had tacked an import price variable onto the equations explaining U.S. inflation, but the rest simply ignored any developments beyond our borders.",LABEL_2,0.9998106360435486
32,"For a monetary policy practitioner, this disconnect raises a puzzle and some very basic concerns.",LABEL_1,0.9845268726348877
33,"A possible implication of the view in the media is that the inflation penalty for allowing economies to run a little ""hotter"" than normal--that is, a bit beyond an economic long-run sustainable output--could be quite small, if there is any penalty at all.",LABEL_2,0.9997891783714294
34,"The academic view implies that for the most part I can proceed with regard to inflation as if the United States is, to a first approximation, a closed economy.",LABEL_2,0.9998348951339722
35,The advance of globalization has increased the range of goods and services available to be imported by U.S. households and firms and reduced the prices of many imported goods and services.,LABEL_2,0.999313473701477
36,"In the case of consumer goods, these developments have directly held down the rate of increase of the imported-goods component of the consumer price index (CPI) and, thus, the rate of increase of the overall index; this direct effect on CPI inflation has risen over time as the import share of household spending has increased.",LABEL_1,0.9868543148040771
37,"Beyond this effect, falling prices for imported materials as well as capital equipment have reduced the production costs of U.S. firms, thereby indirectly restraining the growth of prices of domestically produced goods and services.",LABEL_2,0.9997988343238831
38,Globalization has reinforced disinflation by intensifying the competitive pressures faced by U.S. firms and workers.,LABEL_2,0.9990015625953674
39,"For some firms, the actual or potential availability of less-expensive foreign goods has squeezed profit margins and may have intensified the firms' search for cost-saving productivity enhancements.",LABEL_0,0.869332492351532
40,"For workers in some sectors, labor compensation has likely been restrained by the threat of jobs being shifted overseas to take advantage of lower production costs in the new trading nations, and this wage restraint in turn has helped to hold down domestic prices.",LABEL_2,0.8868952393531799
41,How important have these direct and indirect price effects been?,LABEL_0,0.9987824559211731
42,"A precise answer to this question is beyond our abilities, but we can try to get a handle on the likely magnitude by using a simple reduced-form inflation equation of the sort employed by the Board's staff as an input into its inflation forecasts.",LABEL_0,0.9969605803489685
43,"This equation relates inflation to, among other factors, lagged inflation, resource utilization, and movements in the relative price of imports excluding energy, semiconductors, and computers.",LABEL_1,0.5887766480445862
44,"With it, we can simulate how core consumer prices would have been expected to evolve over the past ten years if relative import prices had remained constant--that is, had import prices gone up in line with those of domestically produced goods rather than rising approximately 1 percent per year slower on average, as actually occurred.",LABEL_0,0.9973573088645935
45,The arithmetic of this exercise suggests that the decline in import prices since the mid-1990s has shaved between 1/2 and 1 percentage point off core inflation over the past ten years.,LABEL_2,0.9998213648796082
46,Some of the historical decline in import prices was probably driven by movements in the dollar's exchange rate largely unrelated to the growing integration of world markets.,LABEL_2,0.778113603591919
47,"For example, the dollar rose strongly in the second half of the 1990s, when investment was attracted here by a pickup in productivity growth and profits.",LABEL_2,0.9998100399971008
48,"And relative import prices would have been likely to decline even in the absence of increased globalization, given the dominant role in trade of manufacturing, in which technological advances have put important restraint on prices.",LABEL_2,0.9997376799583435
49,"On the basis of these considerations, the contribution of globalization to low inflation in the United States in recent years has probably been appreciably smaller than the simple model simulation might suggest--although not necessarily inconsequential.",LABEL_2,0.6337597966194153
50,"In this regard, although direct empirical studies of the effect of an individual country's export prices on the United States are scarce, one recent study by the Board's staff concluded that lower prices of Chinese imports have had at most only modest effects on U.S. prices in recent years, although more-significant effects were recorded in a few specific categories.2 In addition, a focus on past declines in the prices of imported products is only part of the story of the effects of globalization on inflation in this country.",LABEL_2,0.9989475607872009
51,Globalization and the integration of the newly emerging market economies have implications for the demand for goods and services as well as for their supply.,LABEL_0,0.9956417083740234
52,"Perhaps more consequentially, as trade theory, trade models, and recent experience suggest is likely to occur, new global traders are adding significant demand as well--especially for energy, basic commodities, and capital goods.",LABEL_2,0.9995170831680298
53,"For example, between 2000 and 2004, increases in Chinese steel consumption are estimated to have accounted for two-thirds of the increase in global steel demand.",LABEL_2,0.9995100498199463
54,"In fact, historically, industrializing countries have often raised global demand more than supply.",LABEL_2,0.9995452761650085
55,"Their trade accounts tend to be in surplus, in some cases substantially, an indication that they are supplying more goods into the global economy than they are demanding.",LABEL_2,0.9994402527809143
56,"Over time, one would expect the national savings surpluses of these newly integrating economies to decrease or even turn into deficits as opportunities to invest at home come to seem more profitable than placing savings abroad and as the desire of their residents to consume their rising wealth intensifies.",LABEL_2,0.9992349147796631
57,"Rising exchange rates, reflecting increasing productivity and real incomes, would help to reduce the countries' trade surpluses in two ways: Exports to industrial economies would no longer enjoy as large a price advantage and, obviously, would exert less downward pressure on inflation in those economies; and the demand for imports by the developing countries would rise.",LABEL_2,0.9979894161224365
58,"For a variety of reasons, some emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressures on their exchange rates, even if that resistance requires buying large quantities of dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating.",LABEL_1,0.952191948890686
59,"But changes in exchange rates will be helpful in enabling them to adapt to rapidly changing internal and external developments while maintaining economic stability, and their recognition of that advantage should continue to lead to greater flexibility.",LABEL_1,0.9255145192146301
60,"Meanwhile, less than fully flexible exchange rates are probably contributing to the surpluses of these economies and to their disinflationary effect on the rest of the world.",LABEL_1,0.9148919582366943
61,"Taking all these factors into account, where do I come out on the question of how recent trends in globalization have affected inflation in the United States and other industrial countries?",LABEL_2,0.5742706656455994
62,"On balance, under current circumstances, the entry of China, India, and others into the global trading system is probably having a modest disinflationary effect here.",LABEL_1,0.8879777789115906
63,"If some fundamental conditioning factors were to change--for example, if these countries' exchange rates were to rise and their demand to increase--different spending patterns that could reduce the degree of downward pressure on prices might emerge.",LABEL_0,0.9950466156005859
64,"In fact, we cannot rule out the possibility that globalization might some day even create inflationary pressures on balance.",LABEL_2,0.9970754384994507
65,"The Implications for Productivity, Potential Output, and the NAIRU If globalization is having a modest but persistent downward effect on U.S. inflation, what about its effects on employment, the other component of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate?",LABEL_1,0.5998226404190063
66,This job-worker mismatch might for a time tend to raise the economy's sustainable nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).,LABEL_2,0.9997739195823669
67,"As a result, the aggregate labor market readily absorbs such disruptions as those from trade, leaving overall employment little affected.",LABEL_0,0.997136116027832
68,"That we now have an unemployment rate as low as 5 percent, and have sustained that rate without an appreciable pickup of underlying inflation, is evidence that our economy's ability to provide jobs on a sustained basis has not been impaired.",LABEL_2,0.591888964176178
69,"Although globalization should have little effect on aggregate employment and the NAIRU, international trade does expand the economy's productive potential.",LABEL_1,0.9992662072181702
70,"By enabling a country to concentrate on producing those goods and services in which it is most efficient, an expansion of trade boosts the productivity of domestic labor and capital, permanently raising the level of potential output.",LABEL_2,0.9709885716438293
71,"Moreover, the heightened competitive environment fostered by an increasingly global trading system, as I noted earlier, may force firms to be more innovative, further boosting the level, and perhaps even the growth rate, of productivity.",LABEL_0,0.9740197658538818
72,"The expansion in aggregate supply and national income implied by these forces in turn leads to a corresponding rise in aggregate demand; in particular, households are able to increase their standard of living by consuming more goods and services, both imported and domestic.",LABEL_0,0.9925433397293091
73,And it is the balance between potential supply and aggregate demand that concerns monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9998156428337097
74,The Implications for Monetary Policy Globalization in its latest manifestations does not relieve central banks of their responsibility for maintaining price and economic stability.,LABEL_0,0.9190507531166077
75,"Inflation can be affected by a number of factors in the short run, but over time it will be determined by the interactions of aggregate demand, potential supply, and the expectations of businesses and households about future inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9996854066848755
76,"Through their control over the amount of bank reserves in the financial system and short-term interest rates, central banks can influence the balance of demand and potential supply, and their actions may also have direct effects on inflation expectations over time.",LABEL_1,0.7140513062477112
77,"Over the long run, the central bank has full responsibility for determining the economy's average rate of inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9595918655395508
78,"How the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations interact has probably not been changed in any fundamental way by the recent trend of globalization.",LABEL_1,0.9992944002151489
79,"To be sure, the integration of newly industrializing economies into the global trading system is exerting downward pressure on costs and prices.",LABEL_2,0.9996092915534973
80,"But the effect on inflation--the rate of change in prices--has probably not been large to date, and the extent and duration of its damping influence on inflation in the future are open questions.",LABEL_2,0.9981081485748291
81,"Inflation will still rise if central banks allow economies to run ""too hot""--beyond sustainable potential--and such a pickup could become self-perpetuating if it became embedded in inflation expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9997485280036926
82,"True, the specialization and efficiencies resulting from expanding trade enlarge potential supply by increasing productivity, enabling an increase in actual consumption and investment.",LABEL_2,0.9997602105140686
83,And this integration could manifest itself in the interest rates the Federal Reserve needs to implement to keep the economy growing at its potential.,LABEL_2,0.9994825124740601
84,"The result has been lower interest rates here along with a stronger dollar, as well as a larger U.S. current account deficit than probably could have been sustained fifteen or twenty years ago.",LABEL_2,0.9997853636741638
85,"In one sense, an open economy may be more forgiving as shortfalls or excesses in demand are partly absorbed by other countries through adjustments of our imports and exports.",LABEL_2,0.999848484992981
86,"To the extent that the U.S. can more readily draw upon world capacity, the inflationary effect of an increase in aggregate demand might be damped.",LABEL_0,0.7441166639328003
