3,"Otherwise, the challenge for monetary policy is to guide the economy to a sustainable path while preserving low inflation.",LABEL_2,0.971387505531311
4,"This challenge is heightened by the unusual degree of uncertainty about the limits of capacity and potential growth, related in part to ongoing structural changes in the economy.",LABEL_1,0.510836124420166
5,"Concerns have also been raised about potential imbalances in some sectors, for example, about the sustainability of equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account deficit, and debt burdens.",LABEL_2,0.9920797944068909
6,These concerns about sustainability and the challenges they pose for monetary policy are the focus of my remarks this afternoon.,LABEL_1,0.9891582727432251
7,"Varieties of Landings In figure 1, I present four plausible scenarios for future growth.",LABEL_2,0.9932740926742554
8,"During the expansion phase, at least for a period, growth in production typically exceeds the growth in capacity, so that the gap between actual and potential output is closed gradually.",LABEL_2,0.9997764229774475
9,"For the moment, I shall focus exclusively on the concerns about sustainability related to the balance between aggregate supply and demand.",LABEL_1,0.5660126209259033
10,"Later I shall turn to concerns about imbalances in equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account, and the household debt burden.",LABEL_2,0.9997218251228333
11,"A Soft Landing Figure 1.A depicts a soft landing scenario, the graceful transition from the initial output gap to a sustainable growth path at full employment.",LABEL_2,0.9998229146003723
12,"A soft landing occurs if, as the level of output approaches potential, the growth of actual output slows to the growth of potential output just as actual output reaches potential.",LABEL_1,0.5723591446876526
13,Steady inflation is generally one of the signs of sustainability.,LABEL_2,0.9983879327774048
14,"A simple model of inflation dynamics is that changes in inflation are induced by excess aggregate demand or supply, as reflected in the output gap.",LABEL_2,0.8177343010902405
15,"When actual output rises above potential, according to this model, the resulting excess aggregate demand leads to rising inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9961487054824829
16,"In the short run, supply shocks--including both relative price shocks and changes in trend productivity--can also affect inflation dynamics.",LABEL_1,0.9994158744812012
17,"Ultimately, inflation dynamics will be driven by the output gap.",LABEL_2,0.9997833371162415

19,"Looking back, most recessions have resulted from attempts by the policy authorities--yes, the Fed--to reverse increases in inflation generated by overheating.",LABEL_1,0.9994269609451294
20,A Reverse Soft Landing Figure 1.B depicts an alternative scenario in which the above-trend growth in the expansion phase has moved the economy beyond the point of its sustainable capacity to produce.,LABEL_1,0.9965839385986328
21,"In this case, because the economy is already operating beyond its sustainable capacity, the economy may not be able to avoid some acceleration in inflation as policymakers try to engineer the soft landing.",LABEL_1,0.9993662238121033
22,"Therefore, the return to the potential output path has to be achieved in a sufficiently timely fashion to minimize any increase in inflation during the transition.",LABEL_1,0.9991592168807983
23,"Also, in the reverse soft landing case, growth must slow, not just to trend but to below trend in order to close the output gap.",LABEL_1,0.999453604221344
24,"As a result, the unemployment rate must rise during the transition to full employment in this case.",LABEL_0,0.8367565870285034
25,"Hence, whereas the soft landing outcome in figure 1.A involves a stabilization of the unemployment rate at its low point and of inflation near its recent low, in the reverse soft landing case depicted in figure 1.B, both inflation and unemployment rates are likely to rise during the transition.",LABEL_0,0.982249915599823
26,The Best-Case Scenario: Supply Meets Demand The first two scenarios I have described assume that demand has to adjust to a steady supply path to achieve sustainability.,LABEL_1,0.9757761359214783
27,"There are natural equilibrating mechanisms, as well as policy adjustments, that encourage such adjustment in demand relative to supply.",LABEL_1,0.95885169506073
28,An alternative scenario is that supply adjusts to demand.,LABEL_2,0.9937779903411865
29,This case is depicted in figure 1.C in which the growth of potential increases just as output threatens to push beyond potential.,LABEL_2,0.9964178800582886
30,"If this scenario describes the current episode, then the economy can continue to grow at 4 percent, the unemployment rate can remain near 4 percent, and inflation can remain steady at its prevailing rate.",LABEL_1,0.9762336611747742
31,"But it has the advantage of incorporating the role of supply-side as well as demand-side forces that appear to be at work in this expansion, and it would at least help explain the stability of inflation at prevailing growth and unemployment rates.",LABEL_2,0.9475793242454529
32,"Indeed, a possible decline in the NAIRU and, especially, an increase in the growth rate of potential output appear to be essential elements of this expansion.",LABEL_2,0.9948309063911438
33,"Still, even if we take into account the supply-side changes, we should not expect a perfect balancing between supply and demand.",LABEL_1,0.8921173214912415
34,"The upside of a hard landing is that it contributes to reversing imbalances and, afterwards, allows policymakers to aim once again at achieving a healthy, sustainable expansion, ultimately combining full employment, maximum sustainable growth, and price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9998443126678467
35,The first involves the reversal of an imbalance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand.,LABEL_1,0.9977541565895081
36,I will focus first on the boom-bust scenario to complete my classification of paths to sustainable combinations of growth and the output gap.,LABEL_2,0.8545385003089905
37,"In the boom-bust scenario, depicted in figure 1.D, above-trend output growth during the expansion ultimately pushes output well beyond potential for a persistent period.",LABEL_2,0.9997342228889465
38,The resulting overheating puts upward pressure on inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9986135959625244
39,"The monetary policy response to reverse the inflation often yields a decline in output, as depicted here, resulting in a period of economic slack and a reversal of the rise in inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9994632601737976
40,"This is the scenario from which we draw the lesson that timely, typically preemptive, policy restraint to avoid the excesses of a boom results in longer expansions and avoids unnecessary fluctuations in both output and inflation.",LABEL_1,0.6482365727424622
41,"To identify whether the initial conditions today correspond to those in one of the panels of figure 1, we have to assess where output is relative to its potential and whether growth is above or below trend.",LABEL_1,0.9989432692527771
42,This assignment is more difficult than usual because structural changes of uncertain dimension may have raised both the level and the growth rate of potential output.,LABEL_2,0.999842643737793
43,There is also a consensus that the rate of growth of potential output is higher today than during the twenty years preceding this expansion.,LABEL_1,0.7855185866355896
44,"In particular, some think that the rapid growth and low unemployment rate of the past two years represent the economy's new equilibrium (case 1.C), but others believe that the economy has still been running ahead of potential recently, despite structural changes.",LABEL_1,0.9976673126220703
45,"We should not be surprised that a period of structural change would also be one of heightened uncertainty about key parameters, such as the NAIRU and trend growth.",LABEL_1,0.9421724677085876
46,"Table 1 offers various estimates of the NAIRU and trend growth, drawn from researchers, model-based forecasts, assumptions incorporated in government budget projections, and surveys of economic forecasters.",LABEL_2,0.9938606023788452
47,These estimates suggest that actual output is above potential (the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU) and that actual output growth has been above trend growth of potential.,LABEL_2,0.9998146891593933
48,"Despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the NAIRU and the growth of potential give us a hint about what type of landing we should be aiming for and which of the scenarios depicted in figure 1 best describe the economy's initial conditions and prospects.",LABEL_1,0.9984020590782166
49,"That is, even after we incorporate the estimated decline in the NAIRU and the higher rate of growth of potential (as reflected in figure 1.C), output is above potential and output growth exceeds that of potential (as depicted in figures 1.B and 1.D).",LABEL_2,0.9997323155403137
50,"To complete the picture, we also have to rely on the temporary disinflationary effects of favorable relative-price shocks and the increase in the productivity trend that have allowed the economy to operate, for a while, beyond potential without suffering inflationary consequences.",LABEL_1,0.9954010248184204
51,"Hard Landings Associated with the Unwinding of Sector and Market Imbalances Much of the recent concern about the sustainability of this expansion is, nevertheless, not related directly to the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply.",LABEL_0,0.8078666925430298
52,"Most notably, attention has focused on equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account deficit, and debt burdens.",LABEL_0,0.5761897563934326

56,Common Sources of Recent Developments What I do want to focus on this afternoon are possible common sources for the developments pictured in figure 2 and the relation of any imbalance between aggregate supply and demand to those developments.,LABEL_2,0.9998061060905457
57,"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.",LABEL_2,0.997157096862793
58,"The unemployment rate, for example, has declined to a 30-year low.",LABEL_2,0.9997373223304749
59,"Private domestic demand typically is the driver of expansions, but its contribution has been even greater than usual this time.",LABEL_0,0.7746133804321289
60,"The direct contribution of federal government spending and tax changes, reflected in the swing in the federal budget from deficit to surplus, has been a net drag on growth.",LABEL_2,0.9806601405143738
61,So the pace of domestic private demand has been even stronger than the growth in overall output.,LABEL_2,0.9678086042404175
62,"Private domestic spending has been driven, in part, by the wealth effect arising from higher equity prices, a situation that also helps to explain much of the decline in the personal saving rate, and has been financed by a higher household debt and by the tapping of foreign saving.",LABEL_1,0.9954647421836853
63,Also the two types of imbalances--an imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply and sector or market imbalances--could be connected.,LABEL_1,0.9900750517845154
64,Consider a situation in which growth is above trend and output moves beyond capacity.,LABEL_2,0.996826708316803
65,"If investors misread these developments as sustainable and, therefore, extrapolate the exceptional conditions, exceptional and perhaps unsustainable movements in equity prices, the saving rate, and debt burden might be encouraged.",LABEL_1,0.9989261031150818
66,"Alternatively, a rise in equity prices that outstrips fundamentals might contribute to a pace of private domestic demand that ultimately takes output beyond capacity; in this case, the market or sector imbalance would be what contributed to the aggregate demand-supply imbalance.",LABEL_0,0.9162155985832214
67,"Finally, market or sector imbalances could possibly rise to worrisome proportions in the absence of an imbalance between aggregate demand and supply.",LABEL_1,0.9984020590782166
68,This analysis leaves us with four possible combinations: (1) simultaneous imbalances in both aggregate demand/supply and market/sector variables; (2) simultaneous balance in each class; (3) aggregate demand/supply imbalance accompanied by balance in market/sector variables; and (4) aggregate demand/supply balance accompanied by market/sector imbalances.,LABEL_2,0.9972684383392334
69,"A decline in the stock market might also, for example, reduce confidence in the U.S. economy and reduce the willingness of foreigners to accumulate the increment in U.S. liabilities associated with the current account deficit.",LABEL_2,0.9355707764625549
70,"As a result of these considerations, simple multiplier exercises, such as the effect on the economy of a given percentage decline in equity prices, probably tell more about the econometric model used than about prospects for the economy.",LABEL_2,0.9997590184211731
71,"The Challenge for Monetary Policy The most important of the perceived imbalances I have discussed today is, in my view, the possibility of an overheated economy.",LABEL_1,0.7674973607063293
72,"In three of the four combinations of aggregate demand/supply and market/sector imbalances, it seems to me that the best approach would be to focus directly on the aggregate demand/supply imbalance and allow the indirect effects of such a policy to mitigate any other imbalances.",LABEL_2,0.9997367262840271
73,"In addition, any other imbalances are more likely to grow to worrisome proportions during an unsustainable boom and are more likely to unwind in a disruptive manner if confronted by rising inflation, sharply higher interest rates in response to higher inflation, and a subsequent recession.",LABEL_1,0.9987803101539612
74,That leaves the possibility that there might be cases when we face market/sector imbalances in the absence of any aggregate demand/supply imbalance.,LABEL_2,0.999360978603363
75,"In such a case, the level and growth of output are sustainable in the sense that they are not putting pressure on inflation; but this aggregate balance might be threatened subsequently by a spontaneous unwinding of a market/sector imbalance.",LABEL_1,0.9990494847297668
76,What role can and should monetary policy play in such a case?,LABEL_2,0.9993853569030762
77,"Furthermore, it is not obvious how to unwind an excessive debt burden, to raise the personal saving rate, or to narrow the current account deficit in a sustainable way through monetary policy.",LABEL_1,0.998304009437561
78,"As a result, monetary policy, in my view, needs to focus on achieving balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand.",LABEL_2,0.9997664093971252
79,"In pursuing this course, monetary policy is confronted by two competing challenges.",LABEL_1,0.9841399192810059
80,The first is to allow the economy to realize the benefits of any decline in the NAIRU and any increase in trend growth.,LABEL_1,0.9319681525230408
81,Supporting maximum sustainable growth is very much the business of monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9998025298118591
82,But achieving maximum sustainable growth also is about ensuring the sustainability of an expansion and hence avoiding overheating.,LABEL_1,0.9841026663780212
