0,I will then discuss longer-term challenges for the economy and wrap up with a discussion of monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9997690320014954
1,The Current State of the Economy The Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving stable prices and maximum employment--the dual mandate.,LABEL_1,0.9091331362724304
2,"The FOMC has set a longer-term price stability objective of 2 percent annual inflation, as measured by the PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price index.1 This is a symmetric objective, meaning that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9487334489822388
3,"Until early last year, inflation was running substantially below our 2 percent objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices during late 2014 and early 2015.",LABEL_0,0.9883860349655151
4,"However, because prices of energy and food commodities are often volatile, a core measure that excludes these components provides a better indication of where overall inflation is headed.",LABEL_2,0.9995720982551575
5,"While core inflation has also run consistently below 2 percent in recent years, it has been gradually rising, with the most recent 12-month reading at 1.7 percent, three-tenths higher than a year ago (the black line in figure 1).",LABEL_1,0.9983057975769043
6,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved well above their lows of mid-2016 but remain below pre-crisis levels, and survey measures have stayed relatively well anchored.",LABEL_2,0.9238188862800598
7,"Overall, inflation seems to be on track to reach the 2 percent objective over the next couple of years.",LABEL_2,0.9846594333648682
8,"Although inflation is currently below our objective, core inflation has generally been close to 2 percent over the past 20 years.",LABEL_0,0.8118839859962463
9,This outcome reflects the success of monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations.,LABEL_1,0.704645574092865
10,Many indicators show that we have also made significant progress toward maximum employment.,LABEL_1,0.8390639424324036
11,"Since 2010, payroll employment has increased by almost 16 million jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 4.8 percent--in line with most estimates of the longer-run normal level (or natural rate) of unemployment and with the median estimate by FOMC participants in the December 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).",LABEL_2,0.9578123688697815
12,"Accordingly, the red line in the figure indicates that the unemployment rate gap has essentially been closed.2 A variety of other measures also suggest that we are close to maximum employment.",LABEL_1,0.9878554940223694
13,Surveys of household sentiment about the availability of jobs and of business sentiment regarding the difficulty of filling jobs have now reached levels seen in prior periods of full employment.,LABEL_1,0.9876933693885803
14,"Moreover, although the pace of wage increases is slower than during pre-crisis periods of full employment, wages have been increasing faster than both output per hour (productivity) and inflation, and labor's share of income has begun to move up after a long decline.",LABEL_1,0.9635186195373535
15,"All in all, we appear to be close to our employment objective, and are nearing our inflation objective.",LABEL_2,0.9416168928146362
16,"Take the concept of ""maximum employment,"" which requires an estimate of both the natural rate of unemployment for those who are in the labor force and the sustainable level of labor force participation.3 The natural rate of unemployment is not directly observed, and the record suggests that it could be materially lower or higher than current estimates.4 There is also uncertainty about the underlying trend level of labor force participation.",LABEL_2,0.999212384223938
17,"By contrast, other recent work does not find a strong case for a meaningful further slack.6 The issue has important implications, since changes in participation can have material effects on the unemployment rate: Holding the level of employment constant, a 25 basis point change in the participation rate would lead roughly to a corresponding 40 basis point change in the unemployment rate.",LABEL_2,0.9960684776306152
18,Longer-Run Issues Productivity and growth Our economy is strong and operating near its capacity.,LABEL_0,0.6946054100990295
19,But we face important challenges when it comes to the longer-term growth rate of the economy.,LABEL_1,0.6558056473731995
20,"Long-term economic growth depends mainly on nonmonetary factors such as population growth and workforce participation, the skills and aptitudes of our workforce, the tools at their disposal, and the pace of technological advance.",LABEL_2,0.9996528625488281
21,The main long-run contribution monetary policy can make is to provide a stable macroeconomic and financial environment.,LABEL_2,0.9979743361473083
22,The level of potential growth does have important implications for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9991899132728577
23,One of the surprising features of this expansion has been that 2 percent growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has been enough to create solid job gains and unexpectedly large declines in unemployment.,LABEL_1,0.9964015483856201
24,"During much of the recovery, forecasters have been overly optimistic about growth but too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate.",LABEL_1,0.9974580407142639
25,"In 2007, the average expectation for long-run GDP growth from the Blue Chip survey of 50 forecasters was 2.9 percent (figure 3).",LABEL_0,0.9968359470367432
26,"Other forecasters have also lowered their estimates over time, including those sampled by the Survey of Professional Forecasters and, yes, FOMC participants.7 Yet, as this figure shows, unemployment has declined faster than expected.",LABEL_2,0.9986910223960876
27,"The implication is that trend productivity and, ultimately, potential growth are lower than expected.",LABEL_0,0.9648356437683105
28,The decline in estimates of potential growth has been driven largely by unexpectedly weak productivity growth.,LABEL_0,0.9958038926124573
29,"Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year, on average, since 2011--the worst performance over such a period since World War II (figure 4).",LABEL_0,0.9985466599464417
30,"As this figure shows, productivity growth moves around significantly over time and has averaged about 2 percent since 1970.",LABEL_2,0.6764183044433594
31,"One factor behind the decline since the financial crisis is the relatively slow increase in the capital stock per worker, as weak demand and uncertainty about the future have held back business investment.",LABEL_2,0.9998451471328735
32,"But the more important factor has been the marked decline in total factor productivity (TFP), which represents the part of productivity that is not explained by capital increases or increases in the skills of the labor force.",LABEL_0,0.9973040819168091
33,"The decline in TFP growth has been widespread across advanced economies, suggesting that global trends are at play.8 There is no consensus about the future direction of productivity growth.9 Some argue that the important paradigm-changing innovations are behind us, while others think that this slowdown is only a passing phase.",LABEL_0,0.9939972162246704
34,One thing on which all agree is that the future prospects for productivity growth and potential GDP are highly uncertain.,LABEL_0,0.9361909627914429
35,I hope there is also broad agreement on the need for policies that maximize potential growth and spread prosperity as widely as possible.,LABEL_2,0.9996534585952759
36,Low interest rates Another unanticipated feature of this recovery has been the low level of both short- and longer-term interest rates.,LABEL_1,0.996885359287262
37,"Much of the decline is due to significantly lower long-term expectations of inflation, as well as reduced term premiums, likely reflecting both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with anchored inflation expectations, nominal bonds have become an attractive hedge against market risk.",LABEL_0,0.9990159273147583
38,Regulatory changes have raised demand for safe assets.,LABEL_0,0.9929084777832031
39,Lower potential growth implies lower returns and therefore lower rates.,LABEL_1,0.979260265827179
40,Changes in savings and investment demand owing to demographics and other factors have put downward pressure on yields as well.,LABEL_0,0.5717668533325195
41,"Many analysts believe that the neutral rate is even lower than that today and will only return to its longer-run value over time.12 One important implication is that today's low rates are not as stimulative as they may seem--consider that, despite historically low rates, inflation has run consistently below target.",LABEL_0,0.9731202721595764
42,Monetary Policy amid Uncertainty I'd like to turn now to monetary policy.,LABEL_0,0.9986544847488403
43,"I expect the economy to continue broadly along its current path, which implies further labor market tightening and inflation edging closer to 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9996730089187622
44,"On this path, unemployment would decline modestly below current estimates of the natural rate and remain there for some time.",LABEL_1,0.9941340088844299
45,"Before concluding, I would like to turn briefly to a discussion of how policy decisions are made, including the role of simple monetary policy rules.",LABEL_1,0.9959765076637268
46,"Since the 1990s, central banks have grown ever more communicative about their monetary policy decisions.",LABEL_2,0.999840259552002
47,"A central tenet that underlies this increase in transparency is that monetary policy is more effective when the public understands how the central bank will respond to changing conditions, and can calibrate expectations accordingly.13 That means that the Committee must have a clearly communicated, systematic way of responding to changes in economic conditions and the outlook.",LABEL_2,0.9993688464164734
48,"The Committee then makes a collective decision, embodied in the postmeeting statement, setting monetary policy to achieve those goals.14 Over time, incoming information and shocks to the economy inevitably alter views of the appropriate path for monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9994121789932251
49,"These forecasts tend to converge over time to the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective and to each individual's interpretation of maximum employment, because each individual explicitly writes down a path for policy that is intended to achieve those outcomes.",LABEL_2,0.9997794032096863
50,"For example, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland regularly update on the Bank's website an analysis of seven different rules and their prescriptions.17 A good way to see the range of possibilities is through a generalized form of a Taylor-type rule (figure 6).18 As you can see, this rule is based on key factors for monetary policy, such as the neutral real rate of interest, or r*, and deviations of inflation and output or unemployment from their longer-run values.",LABEL_2,0.9988222718238831
51,The rule also calls for an estimate of the output or unemployment rate gap.,LABEL_2,0.9998338222503662
52,"To reduce that uncertainty, we often use the unemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19 We also need to pick values for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his seminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20 There are still other choices to make.",LABEL_2,0.999859094619751
53,Traditional policy rules are backward looking in the sense that they use available data about inflation and output.,LABEL_2,0.9997517466545105
54,"But monetary policy needs to be forward looking, as I discussed, and there are rules that rely on forecasts of inflation and output.",LABEL_2,0.999779999256134
55,"Finally, many have advanced the view that, when times are particularly uncertain, monetary policy should react cautiously to incoming information.21 That insight leads to rules that incorporate inertia, thereby slowing down the movement of rates over time.",LABEL_2,0.9997846484184265
56,"Figure 7 shows the prescriptions of three simple policy rules since 2000.22 While the rules often diverged, all of them called for a substantial reduction in the federal funds rate around the time of the financial crisis, and all of them prescribed easing well below the effective lower bound (ELB).23 Faced with the impossibility of providing more accommodation at the ELB through deeply negative policy rates, the Committee turned instead to two unconventional monetary policy tools--large-scale securities purchases and forward guidance.",LABEL_2,0.9979146122932434
57,"If we replace that intercept with the median of the longer-run r* from the December 2016 SEP, which is 1 percent (the blue dashed line), we see that the rule prescribes policy interest rates lower than the unadjusted rule.",LABEL_0,0.9953643083572388
58,"However, many observers believe that the neutral real interest rate is currently well below its longer-run value.",LABEL_2,0.9958512783050537
59,"The first-difference rule shown by the purple dashed-dotted line incorporates forecasts by prescribing changes to the federal funds rate based on projected inflation relative to its objective and the projected change in the output gap.26 The insight behind this rule is that it does not require estimates of the neutral real rate or the level of the output gap.27 The green dashed line shows the policy prescription from an inertial version of the ""balanced approach"" rule with an intercept of 1 percent, which includes a lagged value of the nominal interest rate.28 This rule does not go as far as the first-difference rule in eliminating the level of r* from the policy prescription, but it does prescribe that policy move only slowly toward its longer-run level, which places less weight in the short-run on the estimate of r*.",LABEL_0,0.9830991625785828
60,This rule prescription is closer to FOMC participants' assessments of appropriate monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9997929930686951
61,"One such consideration of great importance is that, with the secular decline in interest rates over the past 35 years, policy is now far more likely to hit the ELB than had been thought, which may present severe challenges.",LABEL_2,0.9998065829277039
62,But monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between macroeconomic objectives and financial stability.,LABEL_0,0.9844195246696472
63,Recent business cycles show that instability can emerge when inflation is under control.,LABEL_2,0.9996291399002075
