57,Is Inflation Excluding Food and Energy the Best Measure of Underlying Inflation?,LABEL_2,0.9977920055389404
58,The most popular core inflation measures used and published in the United States are quite straightforward: They simply exclude changes in food and energy prices.,LABEL_2,0.9948544502258301

61,"The Bank of Canada, for example, uses a more targeted approach to its core inflation indicator, the CPIX.",LABEL_2,0.9921488761901855

64,"Each month, these measures throw out the components with the largest price changes, both positive and negative (though the Dallas measure is asymmetric).7 Other approaches to estimating core inflation are theory-based measures employing common trends, unobserved components, or a particular model of the economy.8 However, these theory-based approaches tend to be rather complex and require faith that the model they are based on is the right one.",LABEL_2,0.9997542500495911
65,"Each of these measures of core inflation can be evaluated according to a variety of criteria, including the ability to forecast headline inflation over some period and the degree of correlation with alternative definitions of trend inflation.",LABEL_2,0.999678373336792
66,"According to some of these criteria, statistical and theory-based approaches are sometimes found to outperform simpler exclusion measures of core inflation, like the standard one excluding food and energy.",LABEL_2,0.9997792840003967
67,"As you can tell, this is an active area of research, but recent research done at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on U.S. data finds that no one particular core measure, including the standard one, dominates the others: The relative performance of different core measures varies depending on the choice of the price index, the sample period, and the criteria for evaluating their performance (Rich and Steindel, 2007).",LABEL_2,0.9997043013572693
68,"These features of the standard core measure therefore make it a credible device to keep inflation expectations anchored when supply shocks occur: If the standard measure remains stable, then a surge in headline inflation is less likely to unhinge inflation expectations, which as we have seen can lead to both better inflation and better employment performance.",LABEL_2,0.9997169375419617
69,"Why Central Banks Should also Focus on Headline Inflation Despite the advantages of core measures of inflation, their use in conducting monetary policy has been criticized.9 Core measures of inflation attempt to remove the most volatile or transitory components of the inflation measure.",LABEL_2,0.9995937943458557

71,"Unfortunately, as noted above, empirical research suggests that no one measure of core inflation will work in all situations.",LABEL_2,0.9997549653053284
72,"Therefore, central banks do not focus solely on core inflation; rather, they devote considerable resources to understanding inflation developments in an effort to distinguish signal from noise in the incoming data.10 Another reason to keep watch over the broader inflation picture is that, if the rate of change in the price of an excluded item receives a permanent shock, then the headline inflation rate can deviate from the core measure for an extended period of time.",LABEL_2,0.999836802482605
73,"The longer this period of high headline inflation persists, the greater is the risk of second-round effects as the public begins to build this higher inflation into its expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9998586177825928
74,"For example, from 1987 to 2002, energy price shocks appear to have been temporary in that energy prices were mean reverting; as a result, in this period, the average difference between core and headline PCE inflation was quite small.",LABEL_2,0.9998525381088257
75,"Since 2002, however, the effect of energy price shocks have been more persistent, and headline inflation has averaged more than 1/2 percentage point above core inflation over this period.",LABEL_1,0.9240014553070068
76,"Over the past year, energy prices have about leveled off on balance--or at least that was the case until a couple of weeks ago--and the rate of headline inflation for most of this year has come down close to that for core, one hopes alleviating the risk of second-round effects.",LABEL_2,0.999685525894165
77,But the increases in oil prices in recent days provide another reminder that shocks can persist longer than one might have at first expected.,LABEL_2,0.9998030066490173
78,A prolonged divergence between core and headline measures of inflation could complicate central bank communications with the public because core inflation would require some adjustment before it would provide a clear gauge of underlying inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9998284578323364
