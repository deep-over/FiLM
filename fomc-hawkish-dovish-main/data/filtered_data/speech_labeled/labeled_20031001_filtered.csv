10,"Perhaps because of advances in understanding the inflation process, perhaps because of worrisome increases in inflation rates, perhaps because of a discovery that the economic costs of fighting inflation were not as high as previously believed, central bankers in the 1980s suddenly began to use their monetary control to limit the rate of increase in prices.",LABEL_1,0.9992915391921997
11,"Now that something like price stability has arrived, two important policy questions present themselves: Is a mere determination to achieve price stability adequate for central banks to stabilize prices, or should their determination be backed up by more formal institutional structures, such as in inflation-targeting regimes?",LABEL_2,0.8754773139953613

27,There are two ways to evaluate the effect of formal inflation-targeting regimes.,LABEL_1,0.9550332427024841
28,"In the early days of inflation targeting, a number of researchers took the first approach and compared the inflation performance of targeting countries before and after the inflation-targeting regime was introduced.",LABEL_2,0.9998136162757874
29,"In these studies, which measured actual inflation rates and inflation premiums on long-term bonds (to measure expected inflation), one could find evidence that inflation targeting seemed to have worked to bring down inflation and its persistence (see, for example, Kuttner and Posen, 1999; and Freeman and Willis, 1995).",LABEL_2,0.9998447895050049

33,"The advent of the ECB created a huge impediment to such studies because it came into being midway through the relevant data period, and it initiated a centralized regime that had aspects of inflation targeting for many of the large countries that had previously not had such a regime.",LABEL_2,0.9998550415039062
34,"It is difficult to know whether the ECB countries should be considered inflation targeters in the last half of the time-series sample, and it is especially difficult to interpret the experience of these countries.",LABEL_2,0.9997643828392029
35,"Over the 1994-2002 period, seven prominent inflation-targeting industrial countries had a mean inflation rate of consumer prices of 2.1 percent per year with a standard deviation of 1.7 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9998358488082886
36,"One could consider Japan a special case and eliminate it from the latter group, but the two-country results would still show slightly lower and more stable inflation in the nontargeting countries.",LABEL_2,0.998855471611023

40,"When one does ""before and after"" tests for individual inflation-targeting countries spanning this period, inflation targeting often looks successful in bringing about low rates of inflation and in reducing inflation variability and persistence.",LABEL_2,0.998234748840332
41,"But by the late 1990s, inflation had fallen in all industrial countries, and it is hard to find much difference in inflation performance between inflation-targeting and nontargeting countries--if anything, inflation has been lower and more stable in the latter group.",LABEL_2,0.9997898936271667
42,"One is therefore tempted to conclude that the general understanding of the inflation process and a firm determination to achieve price stability, more than the inflation-targeting regime itself, has been the key element in reducing inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9326756596565247
43,How Stable Should Prices Be?,LABEL_2,0.9864717125892639

47,One involves the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates; the other involves labor markets.,LABEL_2,0.9990890026092529
48,"Regarding the zero bound, as inflation drops toward zero, nominal interest rates drop toward real rates, which themselves might be low if the reason inflation is dropping involves negative demand shocks.",LABEL_1,0.9681358933448792
49,"At these low rates, the central bank is poorly positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks.",LABEL_2,0.9995220899581909
50,"Because of the zero bound, it is impossible for nominal interest rates to decline further, but it is still possible for inflation to decline to below zero--that is, for deflation to set in.",LABEL_0,0.9500207304954529
51,The combination implies that real interest rates may actually start to rise in the face of negative demand shocks.,LABEL_0,0.998658299446106

53,"As many have pointed out, the central bank could still respond to negative demand shocks by expanding money growth in various ""nontraditional"" ways.",LABEL_0,0.993935763835907
54,"Today the standard thinking is that the central bank can and should avoid dealing with these difficulties by guiding the economy toward a low, positive rate of inflation, not a zero rate.",LABEL_1,0.9995408058166504
55,"If nominal wages cannot be cut for workers who, for whatever reason, become less productive, labor market flexibility is enhanced by having low positive overall rates of inflation that effectively cut real wages for these workers.",LABEL_0,0.8761613368988037
