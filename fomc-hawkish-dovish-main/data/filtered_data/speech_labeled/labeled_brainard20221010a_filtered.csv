0,"Global supply chains have eased significantly, but by some measures they are still more constrained than at nearly any time since the late 1990s.2 High inflation places a burden on all Americans, but especially lower-income families, who spend three-fourths of their income on necessitiesâ€”more than twice the share spent by higher-income families.",LABEL_1,0.9994946718215942
1,"The Federal Reserve has tightened policy strongly to bring inflation down, and U.S. tightening is being amplified by concurrent foreign tightening.",LABEL_1,0.9992682337760925
2,"We are starting to see the effects in some areas, but it will take some time for the cumulative tightening to transmit throughout the economy and to bring inflation down.",LABEL_1,0.9995812773704529
3,"Higher interest rates are working to temper demand and bring it into better alignment with supply, which is still constrained.",LABEL_1,0.999510645866394
4,"As a result of the significant increase in interest rates and associated tightening in broader financial conditions, I now expect that the second-half rebound will be limited, and that real GDP growth will be essentially flat this year.3 The moderation in demand due to monetary policy tightening is only partly realized so far.",LABEL_1,0.9991793036460876
5,"The transmission of tighter policy is most evident in highly interest-sensitive sectors like housing, where mortgage rates have more than doubled year to date and house price appreciation has fallen sharply over recent months and is on track to soon be flat.",LABEL_1,0.9993140697479248
6,"In other sectors, lags in transmission mean that policy actions to date will have their full effect on activity in coming quarters, and the effect on price setting may take longer.",LABEL_2,0.9997325539588928
7,The moderation in demand should be reinforced by the concurrent rapid global tightening of monetary policy.,LABEL_1,0.9756039977073669

10,"The ratio of job openings to job seekers declined to 1.7; for purposes of comparison, this ratio was 1.2 prior to the pandemic.5 The sharp fall in vacancies at a time when initial claims held steady at low levels provides support for the possibility that businesses that faced significant challenges finding and retaining qualified workers following the pandemic may be more inclined than in past cycles to retain rather than lay off their workers as demand weakens.",LABEL_0,0.9920768737792969
11,"In particular, there is still a sizable 1.2 million shortfall in employment levels relative to pre-pandemic levels in the in-person services sectors that accounted for the majority of September payroll gains, suggesting businesses in those sectors may still be trying to narrow that gap.6 That said, a variety of indicators suggest labor demand remains strong, while labor supply remains below pre-pandemic conditions.",LABEL_0,0.9957385063171387
12,"The unemployment rate is now at the very low level that prevailed pre-pandemic, and the volume of quits remains elevated.7 This supplyâ€“demand imbalance in the labor market is reflected in strong wage growth.",LABEL_0,0.8762291073799133

15,"Although it is well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation, wage growth has been running below current inflation.",LABEL_0,0.956861674785614
16,Strong wage growth along with high rental and housing costs mean that inflation from core services is expected to ease only slowly from currently elevated levels.,LABEL_1,0.9963688850402832
17,"In contrast, core goods have been expected to return to something closer to the pre-pandemic trend of modest disinflation as a result of demand rotation away from goods to services, coupled with the healing of supply chains and declining core import prices.",LABEL_2,0.9244104623794556
18,Disinflation in core goods would help to offset the inflationary pressures in services.,LABEL_2,0.9683131575584412
19,"During the five years before the crisis, core goods made a small negative contribution to inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9988896250724792
20,"The contribution of core goods to inflation swung sharply into positive territory in 2021, and had started to step down somewhat in the middle part of 2022.8 So the surprise in the August inflation data was the large contribution of core goods inflation to overall inflation at a point in the post-pandemic recovery when many forecasts anticipated this contribution would continue moderating.",LABEL_1,0.6095061898231506
21,"Since the pandemic, significant supply and demand imbalances have coincided with large increases in retail trade margins in several sectors.",LABEL_1,0.9947468638420105
22,"The return of retail margins to more normal levels could meaningfully help reduce inflationary pressures in some consumer goods, considering that gross retail margins are about 30 percent of total sales dollars overall.",LABEL_1,0.6374658346176147
23,"For instance, among general merchandise retailers, where the real inventory-to-sales ratio is 20 percent above its pre-pandemic level, retail margins have increased 20 percent since the onset of the pandemic, roughly double the 9 percent increase in average hourly earnings by employees in that sector.9 In the auto sector, where the real inventory-to-sales ratio is 20 percent below its pre-pandemic level, the retail margin for motor vehicles sold at dealerships has increased by more than 180 percent since February 2020, 10 times the rise in average hourly earnings within that sector.10 So there is ample room for margin recompression to help reduce goods inflation as demand cools, supply constraints ease, and inventories increase.",LABEL_1,0.9848173260688782
24,"Despite the higher prices for a broad set of goods and services, market- and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are within ranges consistent with expectations that inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium term.11 Treasury Inflation-Protected Securitiesâ€“based measures of five-year, five-year-forward breakeven inflation compensation are currently at 2.15 percent, roughly 10 basis points below their level at the start of the year.",LABEL_1,0.972195565700531

26,"Previously this reflected a rise in expectations for significantly above-target inflation, but now that dispersion also reflects expectations on the part of one quarter of respondents that prices are likely be the same or below their current level 5 to 10 years in the future.",LABEL_1,0.9904215335845947
27,"In order to bring inflation down and to keep inflation expectations solidly anchored at 2 percent, the Federal Reserve has increased the federal funds rate target range by 300 basis points in the past seven months, and both market and policymaker surveys indicate additional increases through the end of this year and into next year.",LABEL_2,0.9997244477272034
