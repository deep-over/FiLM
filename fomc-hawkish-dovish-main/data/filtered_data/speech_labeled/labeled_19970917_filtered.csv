51,"Of course, the Phillips Curve framework has always been much easier to describe than to implement, given uncertainties about the estimates of NAIRU, given the fact that empirical regularities between inflation and unemployment always left much of the variation in inflation unexplained, and given the importance of supply shocks with significant, though transitory, effects on the inflation-unemployment nexus.",LABEL_1,0.9994908571243286

55,One regularity of past expansions has been the close relationship between two widely used measures of resource utilization -- the capacity utilization and unemployment rates.,LABEL_2,0.9996469020843506
56,"In this case, it did not matter which one was used as a proxy for excess demand; and the unemployment rate could be used interchangeably as a measure of labor market demand pressures and overall economy-wide demand pressures.",LABEL_1,0.8384610414505005
57,The unemployment rate is flashing a warning of a very tight labor market.,LABEL_2,0.9993059635162354

59,"The resulting absence of excess demand in the product market is, in my view, an important factor explaining the frequently reported absence of pricing leverage by firms.",LABEL_2,0.9998117089271545
60,Nothing gives a firm pricing leverage like excess demand.,LABEL_1,0.9953964352607727
61,"In addition, the resulting inability of firms to pass on higher costs in higher prices likely has altered the way firms operate in the labor market, making them more reluctant to bid aggressively for workers, contributing to a slower rate of increase in wages than we would otherwise have expected at prevailing labor utilization rates.",LABEL_2,0.9984215497970581
62,"It is possible that the gap that has opened between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates may be a factor that has, in effect, lowered NAIRU in this expansion.",LABEL_2,0.5638394355773926
63,"Possibilities The most intriguing explanations for the recent favorable performance are structural changes, which may have relaxed the capacity constraints that are the core of the cyclical regularities story, or made these constraints more flexible than in the past, or tempered the ability and/or willingness of firms to respond to excess demand by raising wages and prices.",LABEL_0,0.9908764958381653
64,"There are two possibilities that have been widely discussed: that the economy can now sustain a lower unemployment rate without rising inflation (i.e., that NAIRU has declined) and that, once capacity has been reached, the economy is now capable of faster growth, compared to the estimates of trend growth reported earlier.",LABEL_0,0.9369010329246521
65,"A lot of the discussion about this episode focuses on sorting out the relative importance of the two possibilities -- specifically, whether the recent favorable performance is due more to labor market structural change, as reflected in a lower NAIRU, or to product market structural change, as reflected in a higher rate of growth in productivity.",LABEL_0,0.9941352605819702
66,"The result is a slower rate of increase in compensation at any given level of unemployment, equivalent to a decline in NAIRU.",LABEL_0,0.9920182824134827

69,Has there been an increase in trend productivity?,LABEL_0,0.8204624056816101
70,Another possibility is that the trend rate of increase in productivity -- and hence the economy's sustainable rate of growth in GDP -- has recently increased.,LABEL_0,0.9510401487350464
71,There is some confusion in many discussions of productivity growth about the implications of measurement bias.,LABEL_2,0.9882693290710449
72,"It is widely accepted that there is a downward bias in measured productivity growth, the mirror image of the upward bias in measured inflation.",LABEL_0,0.6218448281288147
73,The measurement issue is relevant to explaining the inflation-unemployment experience in the current episode only if the bias has recently become more serious.,LABEL_0,0.825106680393219
74,"Note also that if the measurement bias has increased, this would imply that both actual and potential output growth are higher than reported, with no obvious implication for the gap between actual and potential output, and hence for inflation pressures.",LABEL_2,0.9998576641082764
75,"Sources of higher productivity growth, all of which should show up in measured productivity, include a return on years of corporate restructuring and the increase in capital per worker associated with the current investment boom, much of which is linked to technological change, specifically the information revolution.",LABEL_0,0.882108211517334
76,No other explanation has the ability to explain as many features of the current experience as an increase in trend productivity.,LABEL_2,0.7667204141616821
77,"There are, however, some problems with this story as the principal explanation for the favorable inflation performance.",LABEL_0,0.9463323354721069
78,"First, a productivity explanation would resonate better if the puzzle were why higher wage change was not being passed on in higher prices.",LABEL_2,0.5239753127098083
79,But the greater puzzle is the slow pace of increase in compensation per hour at prevailing unemployment rates.,LABEL_0,0.9960338473320007
80,"This is more clearly the case after the downward revision in compensation in the July NIPA revisions, bringing that measure of compensation per hour more in line with the Employment Cost Index.",LABEL_2,0.868489682674408
81,"Given the rate of increase in compensation, an unchanged trend growth in productivity of 1.1%, for example, seems quite consistent with recent price performance.",LABEL_2,0.7377102971076965
82,"Although not without some serious shortcomings, the published productivity data provide little encouragement to the view that there has been a significant improvement in underlying productivity growth.",LABEL_0,0.9747496843338013
83,"The growth in measured productivity over this expansion has, in fact, been disappointing.",LABEL_2,0.9990115165710449
84,"Over 1994 and 1995, in particular, measured productivity was nearly flat.",LABEL_2,0.9993752837181091
85,"Although it has accelerated over the last two years, this is consistent with another cyclical regularity, the tendency for productivity to accelerate with economic activity.",LABEL_2,0.8924782276153564
86,"And the rate of growth over the last year, even with the sharp upward revision in the second quarter, is 1.2%, just above the 1.1% average rate of increase over the period from the early 1970s up to the beginning of this expansion.",LABEL_0,0.937933623790741
87,"For example, the acceleration in productivity to a 1.2% rate over the last year, at a time when the unemployment rate was dropping to a level that would suggest less productive workers were being drawn on, leaves open the possibility that the productivity trend has quickened.",LABEL_2,0.9992675185203552
88,Perhaps the strongest case for an increase in the productivity trend comes from the higher rate of growth over the past two years if productivity is measured from the income side of the national accounts.,LABEL_0,0.8684966564178467
89,"Balancing regularities and possibilities In my testimony at the Congressional oversight hearings, I presented a range of estimates for NAIRU and trend growth from the CBO, Council of Economic Advisers, DRI, Macroeconomic Advisers and Professor Robert Gordon.",LABEL_2,0.7808881402015686

92,The Challenge for Monetary Policy Some day we shall look back on this episode with historical perspective and perhaps -- and only perhaps -- have a better ability to sort out what contributed to the favorable outcome and the extent to which the prevailing coexistence of low unemployment and stable low inflation proved permanent or transitory.,LABEL_2,0.9997580647468567
93,"Monetary policy, however, is made in real time.",LABEL_2,0.9997902512550354
94,The appropriate stance of monetary policy should reflect both the increased uncertainty surrounding the failure of historical regularities to predict the better-than-expected outcome in terms of inflation and unemployment and the best judgment about regularities as we update our estimates of NAIRU and trend growth in response to current data.,LABEL_0,0.9983730316162109
95,"At one extreme, the uncertainty about the source of the recent performance might be viewed as so great that the best course for monetary policy is a reactive posture, waiting for clear signs that inflation is rising and only tightening in response to such evidence.",LABEL_2,0.9991015195846558
96,A prudent approach would continue to lean against the cyclical winds by adjusting policy in response to persistent increases in utilization rates as well as in response to changes in underlying inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9997871518135071
