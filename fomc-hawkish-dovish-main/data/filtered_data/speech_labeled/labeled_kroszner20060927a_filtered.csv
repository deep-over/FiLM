17,"One is the contribution to productivity growth that comes from giving workers more capital to work with, such as equipment or software; the standard term for this component is ""capital deepening.""",LABEL_2,0.9991896748542786
18,"The other major contribution comes from the growth of multifactor productivity--that is, the efficiency with which labor and capital are combined to create output.2 Multifactor productivity growth reflects such things as business process innovations--for example, enhanced supply-chain management techniques or more-effective retail store layouts; advancements in technology, such as the development of new-generation computer chips; or most any other type of improvement in the efficiency of a firmâ€™s operations.",LABEL_2,0.9993797540664673

36,"A good deal of research, including the Boardâ€™s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy (FRB/US), suggests that what is called Sayâ€™s law still holds.7 That is, in the model, an increase in the level of productivity (reflecting, for example, some technological advance) causes businesses and financial markets to revise upward their views about the level of expected profits, and it causes households to revise upward their views about the level of permanent income.",LABEL_2,0.8329364657402039

41,"In particular, all else equal, a positive shock to the growth rate of productivity will tend to put upward pressure on real interest rates.9 The upward pressure on real interest occurs, in part, because investment must rise to keep the growth of the capital stock in line with the faster growth of gross domestic product.",LABEL_1,0.9994232654571533
42,"In addition, a shock to the growth rate of productivity boosts householdâ€™s assessments of the growth rate of their permanent income, while increases in the expected growth rate of profits and dividends raise asset values, including the value of equities, relative to current income.",LABEL_2,0.998999297618866
43,"The combination of faster expected growth of permanent income and higher stock market wealth tends to raise consumption relative to income and, concomitantly, lower personal saving.",LABEL_2,0.9987223744392395
44,"Thus, all else equal, the increase in demand for financing relative to domestic saving will tend to boost real interest rates.10 The dynamics of this process, and how long they take to play out, depend on several factors.",LABEL_1,0.8584317564964294
45,One factor is how quickly the productivity change is incorporated into household and business expectations.,LABEL_1,0.9994425177574158

53,The higher prospective returns in the United States may be due in part to the higher productivity growth that the United States has been experiencing relative to many other industrialized countries resulting from the interaction effect of IT innovations and the flexibility of the United States economy relative to other countries.,LABEL_0,0.9669367074966431

56,"In the short run, however, a change in the trend growth rate of productivity can influence inflation dynamics.",LABEL_2,0.9996781349182129
57,"A one-time change in the level of productivity, or transitory volatility in productivity growth rates, are unlikely to have lasting effects on business pricing behavior.",LABEL_2,0.999693751335144
58,"Economic theory and econometric evidence suggest that only a persistent shock to the rate of change of productivity has persistent consequences for rate of change of prices--that is, inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9998419284820557
59,"If we lived in a world with no impediments to competition in labor and product markets, with prices and wages that freely and quickly moved up and down in response to shifts in economic conditions, then a change in productivity growth would be promptly matched by a corresponding change in nominal compensation per hour.",LABEL_2,0.9997865557670593
60,"As a consequence, unit labor costs would be unchanged, and all else equal, so would inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9998200535774231
61,"Nominal compensation per hour initially seems to respond sluggishly to changes in the economy, including productivity shocks.",LABEL_2,0.999779999256134

63,"As price inflation slows and as, with a lag, nominal compensation per hour accelerates, the growth rate of real compensation per hour increases so that over time workers share in the benefits of faster productivity growth.",LABEL_2,0.7034950256347656
64,"Indeed, in the past, any rise in the level of productivity has eventually been fully translated into a rise in the level of real compensation per hour.",LABEL_1,0.9786665439605713
65,"Productivity and Real Compensation Per HourWhat I have dubbed the re-equilibration of productivity and real compensation per hour is just another manifestation of one of the great stylized facts of macroeconomics: In the past, deviations in the labor share of income from its mean value of roughly two-thirds have eventually been reversed.",LABEL_2,0.9045939445495605
66,"As it turns out--Iâ€™ll leave the proof to you as a homework assignment--mean reversion in the labor share is equivalent to the observation that over time labor productivity and real compensation per hour have moved together; in the jargon of econometrics, they are co-integrated.",LABEL_2,0.9996668100357056
67,"As I just mentioned, when the labor share deviates from its long-run average or, equivalently, a gap opens between productivity and real compensation per hour, the reversion to the mean (that is, the closing of the gap) can take quite a while.",LABEL_2,0.9997633099555969
68,"In recent years, the labor share has moved down as increases in real compensation per hour have, for the most part, lagged behind productivity growth, but the timing and extent of the change in the labor share depends in part on the particular statistical measure chosen.13 A challenge for forecasters is deciphering whether this latest drop in the labor share is transitory, as such drops have been in the past, or whether some structural aspect of the economy, such as the wage-bargaining process, has changed to make the drop in the labor share permanent.",LABEL_2,0.9997169375419617
69,"Assuming that the drop is transitory, another challenge for forecasters is predicting whether the adjustment to real compensation per hour will be driven by a pickup in the growth of nominal compensation per hour or by a reduction in inflation.",LABEL_0,0.7826308012008667
70,Prospects for ProductivityLet me close with some comments on the outlook for productivity.,LABEL_2,0.9307701587677002
71,"Recent estimates by a number of economists suggest that the underlying trend in productivity in the nonfarm business sector is about 2-1/2 percent per year, close to the rate of productivity growth achieved during the period from 1995 to 2000.14 I think a good case can be made for the view that the strong productivity growth of the post-1995 era will persist for some time.",LABEL_2,0.999625563621521
