114,"Comparison of the 1970s and the 1990s confirms the common finding in the literature that the degree of ""pass-through"" to core inflation from supply shocks, such as a rise in oil prices or a depreciation of the exchange rate, depends strongly on how well domestic expectations of inflation are anchored.14 Because inflation expectations were not well anchored in the 1970s, the oil price shocks were in fact associated with substantial pass-through, that is, increases in core inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9940667152404785

120,"Although structural changes have occurred in the economy since the 1970s, including increased energy efficiency, this difference in the degree of pass-through from oil prices to general inflation can be explained, in my view, only by differences in the stability of inflation and inflation expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9998233914375305

122,Constrained discretion and inflation targeting I mentioned at the beginning of the talk that constrained discretion characterizes at least to some degree the policy approach of many of the major central banks around the world.,LABEL_1,0.7292861342430115

126,The details of inflation-targeting regimes vary by country and have evolved over time.,LABEL_1,0.7434049248695374
127,"Broadly speaking, however, the operational, or ""what you do,"" side of what I consider to be best-practice inflation targeting is well described as constrained discretion, as I have characterized it here.15 Specifically, most inflation-targeting central banks try to stabilize output and employment subject to the constraint that inflation remain low and stable--in the case of formal inflation targeters, of course, within the declared target range for inflation.",LABEL_2,0.8499230742454529
128,"As I have noted, constrained discretion also describes reasonably well the recent policy approach of the Federal Reserve, though of course the Fed does not have publicly announced inflation targets.",LABEL_2,0.9982534050941467
129,"Thus, on the operational side, the policy frameworks of the Federal Reserve and of the leading central banks with formal inflation targets are today rather similar.",LABEL_2,0.9997403025627136

132,"Here is the principal area in which the Federal Reserve--though it has certainly become markedly more transparent in the past decade--has not chosen to adopt the whole framework of inflation targeting.16 Many have concluded that central banks that have adopted the transparency and communication aspects of inflation targeting have strengthened their overall policy performance--through enhanced communication to the public of their objectives and plans, improved management of expectations, greater consistency of policy, and heightened accountability.17 The Fed has much in common with other major central banks, but of course it also differs in important ways, including its history, legal framework, and institutional structure.",LABEL_2,0.99785977602005
133,Conclusion My objective today has been to lay out the advantages of using a framework of constrained discretion for making monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9972514510154724

135,"Not only does such a commitment enhance efficiency, employment, and economic growth in the long run, but--by providing an anchor for inflation expectations--it also improves the ability of central banks to stabilize the real economy in the short run as well.",LABEL_2,0.9998149275779724

139,"Relative to the more familiar consumer price index (CPI), the PCE deflator (1) has broader coverage, (2) is believed to be based on more accurate expenditure weights, (3) is constructed in a manner that reduces so-called substitution bias, (4) is measured more consistently over time, and (5) arguably does a better job measuring medical inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9998260140419006
