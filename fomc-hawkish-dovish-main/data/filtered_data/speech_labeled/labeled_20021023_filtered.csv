9,"Unlike cutting fat, which permanently elevates the levels of productivity, these gains in output per hour are often temporary, as more demanding workloads eventually begin to tax workers and impede efficiency.",LABEL_2,0.9055661559104919
10,"Perhaps the return to a low-inflation environment in recent years in itself explains the intensification of competitive pressures, which has been a spur to the growth of productivity.",LABEL_0,0.9613059163093567
11,"Indeed, the data do suggest a relationship between inflation and productivity growth over the long run.",LABEL_2,0.999812662601471
12,"But that statistical relationship is modest at best and inferring causality is complicated by a circularity that arises because increased growth in output per hour depresses unit labor costs and, hence, prices.",LABEL_2,0.6605631709098816

15,"Only in retrospect, if then, will we be able to ascertain how much of the past year's elevated growth in output per hour was transitory--that is, growth that resulted from cutting of fat, reorganizing operations, and more fully exploiting technologies already embedded in the existing capital stock.",LABEL_2,0.9993756413459778

19,The quantitative evidence on the magnitude of this effect spans the range from significant to small.2 The ability of businesses to boost productivity with what seems to be minimal new capital investment over the past two years suggests that output per hour growth in the later years of the 1990s likely trailed the growth in underlying productivity in those years.,LABEL_2,0.9990332126617432
20,"If this inference is accurate, part of that earlier growth in underlying productivity is being reflected in today's gains in output per hour.",LABEL_2,0.5643300414085388
21,"The difficulty in explaining the recent past is most evident when we decompose gains in output per hour into the contribution from changes in worker quality, the amount of capital used by workers--that is, capital deepening--and the contribution from all other factors, a notion that economists label ""multifactor productivity.""",LABEL_2,0.999724805355072

25,"Conversely, it seems very unlikely that all of the increase in the growth of productivity could be attributed to structural influences.",LABEL_0,0.9958778619766235
26,"At minimum, however, it seems reasonable to conclude that the step-up in the pace of structural productivity growth that occurred in the latter part of the 1990s has not, as yet, faltered.",LABEL_1,0.9586532711982727

32,"Then, for the quarter century following World War II, productivity growth rose to an average rate of 2-3/4 percent before subsiding to a pace of 1-1/2 percent annually from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s.3 Arguably, the pickup in productivity growth since 1995 largely reflects the ongoing incorporation of innovations in computing and communications technologies into the capital stock and business practices.",LABEL_2,0.9995114803314209

34,"If the backlog of unexploited long-term profitable technologies remains high, it should be assumed that once currently elevated risk premiums and the heightened cost of equity capital (and some debt) recedes, or cash flows expand, new productivity-enhancing capital investment will pick up.",LABEL_2,0.9564017057418823
35,"Further evidence that firms still have not fully adapted their operations to the latest state of technology also is provided in a recent study4 that attempts to measure the ""technological gap""--that is, the difference between the productivity of leading-edge capital and the average productivity embodied in the current capital stock.",LABEL_2,0.9992449283599854

39,"Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh use a similar methodology and find a range from a little less than 1-1/2 percent to about 3 percent with a central tendency of around 2-1/4 percent.5 These estimates are clearly plausible, but history does raise some warning flags concerning the length of time that productivity growth continues elevated.",LABEL_0,0.9977288842201233

46,"In contrast to the boom in productivity after World War I, which many economists associate with a few key innovations, analysts usually ascribe the post-World War II boom to innovations in many sectors reflecting the diffusion through the private economy of (a) new technologies that appeared in the 1930s but were not fully implemented during the Depression, and (b) a gradual application to civilian activities of military-related innovations.",LABEL_2,0.9993183612823486
