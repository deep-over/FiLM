0,My subject this afternoon will be inflation dynamics.,LABEL_2,0.9998181462287903
1,"Since the mid-1980s, we have seen important improvements in these dynamics--inflation is now much lower and more stable than it once was, and it appears to be less closely correlated with movements in other economic factors than it was during the 1960s and 1970s (see table).",LABEL_2,0.9994552731513977
2,"Questions of intense interest to many of you as well as to us at the Federal Reserve are, What caused these changes in the inflation process?",LABEL_2,0.9764785766601562
3,and What are their implications for monetary policy?,LABEL_2,0.9997867941856384
4,"Having spent many years as a University of Chicago professor, my first reaction to these changes is to think â€œmoney.â€ As Milton Friedman famously said many years ago, â€œInflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.â€ Unfortunately, given the lack of a stable relationship between money growth and inflation, the pure monetarist view has taken a beating since then.",LABEL_2,0.9994445443153381
5,"However, Friedman was right that inflation is, ultimately, something that central banks determine, at least on average, over time.",LABEL_2,0.9997435212135315
6,"Views about the inflation process vary, but expectations are at the heart of almost all of them.",LABEL_2,0.9994681477546692
7,"And in any model in which expectations are important, monetary policy will also be important.",LABEL_2,0.9998283386230469
8,"So monetary policy, if not money itself, remains a central determinant of inflation dynamics.",LABEL_2,0.999761164188385
9,"Accordingly, one of my principal themes today will be that expectations are important in the inflation process and that the improved conduct of monetary policy, by influencing the formation of expectations in a favorable manner, may account for many of the changes in inflation dynamics that we observe.",LABEL_2,0.9995230436325073
10,"At the same time, I am wary of ascribing all of the changes in dynamics to monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9998244643211365
11,"We should not place too much faith in any one framework, and so we need to keep an open mind about other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.",LABEL_2,0.9993160963058472
12,"The Expectational Approach to Thinking about Inflation Now almost forty years old, the expectational approach to inflation dynamics--developed simultaneously by Friedman and recent Nobel prize winner Edmund Phelps--is still the dominant framework for thinking about inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9998044371604919
13,Let me begin with a quick review of what Friedman and Phelps said forty years ago and then discuss very briefly how it relates to current thinking about the inflation process.,LABEL_2,0.9998539686203003
14,"In Friedmanâ€™s framework as expressed in his 1967 presidential address to the American Economics Association, inflation is related to inflation expectations as well as the level of resource utilization.",LABEL_2,0.9995290040969849
15,"Friedman explained that for a variety of real-world reasons, wages and prices might not always adjust immediately to changes in the money supply.",LABEL_2,0.9997894167900085
16,"If they did not so adjust, monetary policy could affect resource utilization.",LABEL_2,0.9981410503387451
17,"The reason that Friedmanâ€™s work, and that of Phelps, was so revolutionary was that it overturned the earlier belief that monetary policy could have a permanent influence on resource utilization in favor of a new view that monetary policy could affect real activity only temporarily.",LABEL_2,0.9998167157173157
18,"In the early 1970s, Robert Lucas expanded on the ideas of Friedman and Phelps and noted that shifts in the way a central bank conducts monetary policy imply changes in the way the public forms its expectations.",LABEL_2,0.9997884631156921
19,"Over the past thirty years, economists have taken these observations to heart in trying to explain the behavior of overall inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9997707009315491
20,One standard approach starts with the notion that many wages and prices adjust only gradually to changes in costs and demand.,LABEL_2,0.9998103976249695
21,"That assumption about the microeconomic behavior of price setters has recently been bolstered by some research that has looked at the data underlying the consumer price index to assess how often prices change (Bils and Klenow, 2004).",LABEL_2,0.9997479319572449
22,"The research finds that, indeed, prices for many goods and services appear to adjust only gradually, with the typical firm changing the price of a typical item about once every four months.",LABEL_2,0.9998130202293396
23,"When wages and prices adjust only infrequently, expectations are important, because firms and households must take into account the demand and supply conditions that will prevail until they again reset their prices.",LABEL_2,0.9996967315673828
24,"All sorts of expectations will matter, but central among them are inflation expectations: If wages and prices in general are rising over time, then when firms have a chance to reset their prices, they will generally set them higher than they would if the overall price level was holding steady.",LABEL_1,0.9945151805877686
25,"Because the new approaches to understanding inflation are grounded in the behavior of individual decisionmakers, they have the solid theoretical foundations that are valuable for policy analysis.1 Moreover, some evidence indicates that empirical models based on this research do fairly well at forecasting.",LABEL_2,0.9996496438980103
26,"Of course, time will tell about their usefulness in the day-to-day operations of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9998371601104736
27,"Changes in Inflation Dynamics As I noted earlier, the inflation process seems to have changed in a number of ways in recent years, both in the United States and in other countries.",LABEL_2,0.9997890591621399
28,I would like to review these changes and then consider what they may tell us about the underlying processes driving inflation.,LABEL_2,0.99983811378479
29,"One notable change is that movements in inflation now appear to tell us much less about future inflation than was the case, say, thirty years ago.",LABEL_2,0.9997953772544861
30,"Here I am talking about predictions of inflation using only information on past inflation, without taking into account any other information.",LABEL_2,0.9998252987861633
31,"The evidence suggests that, at the peak of U.S. inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the best such â€œunivariateâ€ forecast of inflation--into the indefinite future--was a simple average of inflation over the past few quarters (Stock and Watson, 2007; Cecchetti and others, 2007).",LABEL_2,0.999825656414032
32,"In that period, sharp increases in inflation were reversed only slowly.",LABEL_1,0.9980353713035583
33,"By contrast, shocks to inflation since roughly the mid-1980s have tended to be short-lived, so that the best forecast of future inflation would be a very long average of past inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9997348189353943
34,"Thus, when inflation moves above its recent long-run average, most of the upswing will likely be quickly reversed, although this result is not guaranteed.",LABEL_0,0.8794223070144653
35,Thatâ€™s a remarkable change in the behavior of inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9930782914161682
36,"The international evidence indicates that the longevity of inflation shocks has been attenuated in many other countries as well (Cecchetti and others, 2007).",LABEL_2,0.9982506632804871
37,"Moreover, the timing of the switch from largely permanent to mostly transitory movements in inflation is remarkably similar across the United States and these other countries.",LABEL_2,0.9998050332069397
38,"Another apparent change in the inflation process has been a reduction in the correlation between inflation and unemployment (Atkeson and Ohanian, 2001; Roberts 2006).",LABEL_2,0.9798622131347656
39,"Now, this relationship was always loose, as most of the historical variation in inflation has reflected influences aside from movements in unemployment or other measures of resource utilization.",LABEL_2,0.9998283386230469
40,"Still, in the 1960s and 1970s, a reasonably strong empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment could be found for the United States, with inflation tending to rise in periods when unemployment was low and vice-versa.",LABEL_2,0.9941613078117371
41,"In fact, some researchers now find no relationship at all, whereas others tend to find one that is of reduced economic importance.2 Again, similar shifts have been observed in other countries, and these results are not sensitive to whether we are looking at core inflation or total inflation (Borio and Filardo, 2006; Ihrig and others, forthcoming).",LABEL_2,0.9998304843902588
42,Next on the list of changes is the influence of energy prices.,LABEL_2,0.9996625185012817
43,"During the 1970s, fluctuations in energy prices appear to have had a significant influence on core inflation--that is, on the growth rate of consumer prices excluding food and energy.",LABEL_2,0.9998347759246826
44,"But since the early 1980s, the inflationary effect of movements in prices for gasoline, natural gas, and other energy goods seems to have declined considerably, even after allowance is made for a secular decline in the energy intensity of the U.S. economy (Hooker, 1996).",LABEL_2,0.9993467926979065
45,"Indeed, some estimates even suggest that energy price shocks have no effect whatsoever on core inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9998038411140442
46,"From a cost-accounting perspective, estimates of a zero effect seem too improbable to be taken literally: Recent swings in energy input costs have been sufficiently large that they should have had a noticeable effect on the prices of other goods and services, even allowing for their relatively small share in overall costs.",LABEL_2,0.9994737505912781
47,"I will return later to possible explanations for the sharp drop in the estimated effects of movements in energy prices.3 Finally, one of the most striking changes in the U.S. economy in recent decades has been the reduction in the economyâ€™s volatility.",LABEL_2,0.9990928173065186
48,"The standard deviation of quarterly growth of real (that is, inflation adjusted) gross domestic product for the United States since the mid-1980s has been about half that experienced during the 1960s and 1970s.",LABEL_2,0.9987040758132935
49,"The volatility of inflation has fallen to a similar degree; moreover, the reduction in volatility for both output and inflation is widespread across countries.",LABEL_2,0.9991102814674377
50,"Of course, a smaller volatility of real GDP is not a change in inflation dynamics.",LABEL_2,0.6688637137413025
51,"But if monetary policy has been an important factor behind the drop in the economyâ€™s volatility, then the expectational mechanisms may be very similar to those affecting inflation dynamics.4 Expectations, Monetary Policy, and Changing Inflation Dynamics As Lucas pointed out, because expectations matter for inflation, monetary policy matters for inflation, too.",LABEL_2,0.9997546076774597
52,"And the historical record supports the notion that, starting with Chairman Paul Volcker, U.S. monetary policy has been more focused on low and stable inflation than was the case in the 1960s and 1970s (Romer and Romer, 2002).",LABEL_2,0.9997403025627136
53,"So it is natural to ask, can changes in the conduct of monetary policy in the United States (and elsewhere) help to account for the changes weâ€™ve seen in inflation dynamics?",LABEL_1,0.5196025371551514
54,The strongest case for a link between monetary policy and changes in inflation dynamics is in the greater stability of inflation.,LABEL_2,0.999786913394928
55,"Inflation is clearly under the long-run control of the Fed, and the relative stability of inflation clearly reflects the action of monetary policy.",LABEL_1,0.5664078593254089
56,"Thus, if the central bank wants to keep inflation low on average over time, it can surely do so.",LABEL_1,0.539680004119873
57,The case for monetary policy contributing to reduced volatility of inflation is also fairly straightforward: The central bank can stabilize inflation by raising and lowering interest rates to lean against inflationary disturbances.,LABEL_1,0.9050799012184143
58,"Once we take account of the role of expectations, the stabilizing effects of monetary policy become even greater: If economic decision makers come to realize that the Fed is doing more to stabilize inflation, then shocks that push up inflation will lead to smaller increases in inflation expectations than in the past.",LABEL_1,0.9189346432685852
59,"Because current inflation is affected by inflation expectations, the smaller increase in expected inflation will lead to a smaller increase in actual inflation as well.",LABEL_1,0.999352753162384
60,"And because many shocks that may lead to inflation, such as unexpected surges in spending, also cause movements in output and employment in the same direction, the maintenance of price stability promotes the stability of the real economy.",LABEL_1,0.995955228805542
61,"This experience of low and stable inflation, coupled with the Fedâ€™s clear statements of commitment to maintaining this performance, has no doubt contributed to the stability of long-run inflation expectations in the past decade or so.",LABEL_2,0.6982675790786743
62,By one measure--from the Philadelphia Fedâ€™s Survey of Professional Forecasters--long-run inflation expectations have barely budged since 1998.,LABEL_2,0.9409634470939636
63,Better monetary policy may also help explain the apparent decline in the sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization.,LABEL_2,0.9997878670692444
64,We might interpret the reduced statistical correlation between unemployment and inflation as evidence of a decline in the direct effect of resource utilization on inflation.,LABEL_0,0.9495763778686523
65,"But given that the conduct of monetary policy was changing at the same time, it may be premature to draw such a conclusion.",LABEL_2,0.9983830451965332
66,Suppose that the Federal Reserve managed to stabilize inflation perfectly.,LABEL_2,0.9998179078102112
67,"That outcome would eliminate any empirical correlation between inflation and unemployment even if there really was an underlying relationship between inflation and resource utilization operating through the influence of the latter on, say, marginal labor costs.5 As this example illustrates, the correlation between unemployment and inflation may have no bearing on whether these variables are truly linked structurally.",LABEL_2,0.9990295171737671
68,I hasten to add that I am not advocating that the Fed stabilize inflation perfectly--this is simply an illustrative example.,LABEL_2,0.9998382329940796
69,"So letâ€™s consider another alternative: Suppose that the Fed is willing to accept some temporary deviation of inflation from its desirable level to moderate an accompanying weakness in real activity, as might occur in the face of an adverse productivity shock.",LABEL_2,0.9988922476768494
70,"In this instance, the most likely correlation between inflation and unemployment would be positive--that is, under these conditions the relationship between inflation and unemployment would be the exact opposite of the predictions of the old-fashioned Phillips curve.",LABEL_0,0.9907664060592651
71,"And again, this result could arise even though the structure of the economy was such that an increase in resource utilization would tend to put upward pressure on production costs and thus prices.",LABEL_2,0.9996053576469421
72,"From this perspective, the declining correlation of resource utilization with inflation may be an indication of the success of monetary policy in pursuing its dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable growth: Because the Fed is trying to stabilize both inflation and real activity, then, when faced by shocks that push these variables in the same direction, the Fed will want to try to offset both adverse developments to the extent that it can.",LABEL_2,0.9594953656196594
73,"Thus, I see the reduced correlation between inflation and unemployment as an indication of the success of monetary policy in this dimension.",LABEL_1,0.9921953678131104
74,Further evidence that better monetary policy and accompanying expectational effects have promoted a more stable economy is provided by the rather muted inflationary effects of the recent sharp increases in crude oil prices.,LABEL_1,0.9113659858703613
75,"In the 1970s, inflation moved up sharply with increases in crude oil prices.",LABEL_1,0.9992294311523438
76,"Moreover, not only did overall inflation move up, but core inflation, wages increases, and inflation expectations moved up as well.",LABEL_1,0.9991195797920227
77,"In response to the resulting high inflation, the Fed was obliged to raise interest rates, and the economy weakened.",LABEL_1,0.9991841912269592
78,"True, overall inflation moved up with energy prices, and some of the pickup in core inflation last year probably reflected the transitory effects of the pass-through of increased energy costs.",LABEL_1,0.995654821395874
79,"Similarly, when gasoline prices surge, surveys of household inflation expectations still move up, but not for long.",LABEL_1,0.9995259046554565
80,"Indicators of long-term inflation expectations did not exist in the 1970s, but in the current period, the stability of these expectations has been remarkable.",LABEL_1,0.9792559146881104
81,"As I shall discuss, other explanations for these changes exist, but in my view, the effects of monetary policy are the most plausible.",LABEL_2,0.9798256754875183
82,What can the international experience tell us about the likely sources of the changes in inflation dynamics?,LABEL_2,0.9814103841781616
83,"First, we need to acknowledge that many of the changes we have seen in U.S. inflation dynamics have also occurred in other countries.",LABEL_2,0.9997872710227966
84,That fact suggests that at least some of the explanations of the change in inflation dynamics should be common across countries rather than country-specific.,LABEL_2,0.999806821346283
85,"If monetary policy is central to these changes, it must be the case that many countries have made similar changes to monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9981040954589844
86,"As I noted in a speech last fall, one possible reason for such common changes in monetary policy may have been greater currency competition (Kroszner, 2006).",LABEL_2,0.9997597336769104
87,"In broad terms, the idea is that increased globalization, deregulation, and innovation raised the returns to low inflation--and increased the penalties for high inflation--relative to results obtained twenty or thirty years ago.",LABEL_2,0.9997877478599548
88,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.",LABEL_2,0.9996742010116577
89,"Almost everywhere, public opinion eventually turned against allowing inflation to continue.",LABEL_2,0.9978742599487305
90,This public pressure has reinforced the trend against inflationary policies.,LABEL_1,0.9331996440887451
91,"Increased competition among currencies, driven by the confluence of factors that I just described, has limited the ability of governments and central banks to pursue high-inflation policies.",LABEL_1,0.9909244179725647
92,"Moreover, currency competition has raised the costs of poor policy and thus increased the incentives of the monetary authorities to maintain low inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9957976341247559
93,"Other Explanations for the Change in Inflation Dynamics Of course, monetary policy may not be the whole story, and we need to resist embracing any single explanation too wholeheartedly.",LABEL_1,0.9933403134346008
94,There may be other reasons for the changes in inflation dynamics.,LABEL_1,0.9993796348571777
95,"For example, the reduced sensitivity of core inflation to oil and natural gas prices likely also reflects both the increased energy efficiency of the economy and the fact that shocks to the prices of these goods since the mid-1980s have, at least until the latest episode, been viewed as mostly temporary.",LABEL_2,0.9996504783630371
96,"In contrast, the rise in oil prices during the 1970s was probably seen at the time as largely reflecting a permanent shift in global demand/supply balances.",LABEL_2,0.9997155070304871
97,Another factor that might help to account for some of the changes in inflation dynamics is globalization.,LABEL_2,0.9996753931045532
98,This development could help to account for any reduced sensitivity of U.S. inflation to domestic resource utilization.,LABEL_1,0.9992460012435913
99,"In fact, one recent study even purports to show that foreign output gaps are more important in explaining domestic inflation in industrialized countries than domestic factors (Borio and Filardo, 2006).",LABEL_2,0.9997560381889343
100,"Other factors may also be at work, such as the deregulation of the 1980s and the faster productivity growth we have seen over the past decade.",LABEL_2,0.9995170831680298
101,"But I think that even after we have given these factors their appropriate due, the evidence still suggests that better monetary policy explains much (albeit not all) of the changes in inflation dynamics that have occurred.",LABEL_2,0.9996310472488403
102,"In fact, it is interesting to speculate on the degree to which better monetary policy might account for some of the structural factors I have listed.",LABEL_0,0.7679226994514465
103,Consider faster productivity growth.,LABEL_2,0.6247001886367798
104,High and variable inflation likely creates a distraction for firms--managers must pay attention to the damage that inflation can do to their balance sheets.,LABEL_2,0.9995286464691162
105,Such distraction likely hurts the productivity of firms.,LABEL_0,0.9923655390739441
106,"Although I donâ€™t think low inflation is the only factor behind the rebound in productivity growth in the United States--after all, other countries did not see such an acceleration in output per hour as inflation came down--I think it has played a role.",LABEL_1,0.9995266199111938
107,Policy Implications A review of the possible causes of the changes in inflation dynamics naturally leads to the question of their implications for the conduct of monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9909336566925049
108,"In todayâ€™s economy, it is very difficult to know whether any given change in output or employment will have inflationary consequences.",LABEL_0,0.996738612651825
109,"One lesson that is fair to draw, however, is that resource utilization generally does not tell us much about the future course of inflation over the next year or two.",LABEL_2,0.9997851252555847
110,"Rather, the near-term inflation outlook is more likely to be dominated by cost factors, such as productivity growth and the price of raw materials, than by the tightness of labor and product markets.",LABEL_2,0.9997722506523132
111,"Furthermore, the weak relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate means that it is probably more difficult than ever to gauge the economyâ€™s productive potential--and hence estimate so-called output gaps--especially in real time.",LABEL_2,0.9998613595962524
112,My earlier comments also underscored the central importance of expectations to the successful conduct of monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9969354867935181
113,"In particular, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks appear to have succeeded in anchoring long-run inflation expectations--an achievement that has contributed to macroeconomic stability and eased the task of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9983782768249512
114,The final lesson I draw is a cautionary note: The stability of inflation could lead to complacency.,LABEL_2,0.9997732043266296
115,"As long as inflation expectations are well anchored, actual inflation will have a natural tendency to revert to the anchor of long-run inflation expectations.",LABEL_1,0.7936774492263794
116,"Under such circumstances, policymakers may be tempted to relax their resolve in responding to potentially inflationary developments.",LABEL_1,0.8786731362342834
117,Inflation expectations have become well-anchored because the public has become confident that the Federal Reserve will do the right thing.,LABEL_2,0.9944726824760437
118,But this belief will persist only as long as we on the Federal Open Market Committee continue to ratify the publicâ€™s expectations that inflation will remain low and stable.,LABEL_1,0.7983779311180115
119,"Thus, complacency would be a threat to the credibility that the Federal Reserve has worked so hard to acquire, and its loss would likely mean the reversal of many of the favorable inflation developments seen over the past two decades.",LABEL_1,0.9978267550468445
120,One message that I hope has been clear is that there is much we donâ€™t know about the inflation process.,LABEL_1,0.9973763227462769
