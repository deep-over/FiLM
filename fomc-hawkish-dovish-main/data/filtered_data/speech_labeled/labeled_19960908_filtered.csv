15,"First, in the absence of policy adjustment, is the economy slowing or likely to slow to trend quickly enough to stabilize the unemployment rate at its current level?",LABEL_2,0.9993138313293457

18,"Of course, one has to be careful interpreting these forecasts, because some of the private sector forecasts that have growth slowing to trend do so in the context of an assumed modest tightening of monetary policy, but many suggest a slowing to trend without such an adjustment.",LABEL_2,0.9986372590065002
19,I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.,LABEL_0,0.9478495717048645
20,"However, above-trend growth, without an accompanying increase in participation rates, implies further decline in the unemployment rate which may already be at or even below its full employment level.",LABEL_2,0.9991806149482727
21,"A further decline in the unemployment rate, from its current level, would, in turn, increase the risk of an acceleration of inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9441972374916077

39,I have emphasized throughout my career the importance of the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve in my view of the inflation process and its value as a forecasting tool.,LABEL_2,0.9990046620368958
40,But the tension is there and we have to weigh the risk of higher inflation if the longer-run estimate of NAIRU proves correct against the potential that the recent stability in inflation reflects a change in structure that will persist.,LABEL_2,0.9996936321258545

43,"Labor costs, of course, are based on total compensation not wages, so we might want, especially given the slowdown in benefit cost inflation, to keep our focus on the broader compensation measure rather than on wage change alone.",LABEL_1,0.9995042085647583
44,"The question here is whether the current rate of increase in compensation remains consistent with stable price inflation, either because it is being accompanied, at least for a while, by a compression in profit margins or because it still remains low relative to trend productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9997066855430603

53,"Let's assume, for the sake of the rest of my remarks, that growth slows to trend, the unemployment rate stabilizes at its current level, and inflation remains stable.",LABEL_2,0.9998394250869751
54,What then for monetary policy?,LABEL_2,0.9996448755264282
55,"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.",LABEL_2,0.9997572302818298
56,"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.",LABEL_2,0.9997363686561584
57,Full employment can be achieved either with price stability or with positive stable inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9990708827972412
58,"So the mandate, in my interpretation, does dictate that we move to price stability, because this is only there that we can achieve both objectives simultaneously.",LABEL_1,0.7348119020462036
59,"That still leaves us the strategic question of how to juggle the goals of full employment and price stability in the short run when the initial conditions do involve a conflict among the ultimate objectives--for example, the current combination of modest, stable inflation and full employment.",LABEL_1,0.9968243837356567
60,It is desirable that monetary policy respond to this challenge in a systematic way.,LABEL_2,0.9993510842323303
61,This would allow the private sector to both anticipate where monetary policy is headed and retain confidence that the Federal Reserve remains focused on its long-run objective as it carries out its meeting-to-meeting policies.,LABEL_2,0.9957977533340454
62,The Taylor Rule is a simple example of a strategy that juggles the two objectives in a disciplined manner without losing sight of the long-run price stability objective.,LABEL_2,0.9998119473457336
63,The Taylor Rule varies the real federal funds rate relative to some equilibrium level in response to both the deviation of output from its full employment level and of inflation from its long-run target.,LABEL_1,0.8102107644081116
64,"This rule, in effect, worries continuously about both output relative to potential and inflation relative to price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9994315505027771
65,But the Taylor Rule helps illustrate some important aspects of monetary policy strategy.,LABEL_2,0.999723494052887
66,"The Taylor Rule would resolve the near-term conflict between objectives in the current economic environment by encouraging some slack in the economy and thereby ensuring downward pressure on inflation over time, as long as inflation were above the long-run inflation target, while still balancing along the way both the inflation and employment objectives.",LABEL_2,0.999819815158844
67,"Opportunistic Disinflation A couple of years ago, I gave the name ""opportunistic disinflation"" to an alternative strategy for bridging between short-run policy and long-run goals, a strategy that I observed the Federal Reserve to be following at the time.",LABEL_1,0.920350193977356
68,"Under this strategy, once inflation becomes modest, as today, Federal Reserve policy in the near term focuses on sustaining trend growth at full employment at the prevailing inflation rate.",LABEL_2,0.9985583424568176
69,At this point the short-run priorities are twofold: sustaining the expansion and preventing an acceleration of inflation.,LABEL_0,0.7142025232315063
70,"This is, nevertheless, a strategy for disinflation because it takes advantage of the opportunity of inevitable recessions and potential positive supply shocks to ratchet down inflation over time.",LABEL_1,0.9803579449653625
71,Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,LABEL_1,0.9995105266571045
72,"Under this strategy, if growth were to slow to trend, the unemployment rate were to remain where it is, and inflation were to remain stable, monetary policy would remain on hold, ready to respond aggressively to any acceleration of inflation, but otherwise prepared to be patient and accept the lower inflation that will accompany the next recession or favorable supply shock.",LABEL_0,0.7445276379585266
73,So let me sum up how I look at the challenges facing monetary policy in the current economic environment and in light of the longer run strategic issues I have set out this evening.,LABEL_1,0.9994543194770813
74,"In the near term, I believe we should be vigilant to insure that the progress made to lower inflation to the current level is sustained.",LABEL_2,0.5534890294075012
75,"I am, as a result, focused on forecasts of near-term growth relative to trend as a forward-looking indicator of changes in utilization rates, on utilization rates themselves as forward-looking indicators of inflation pressures, on labor costs as a key factor in the transmission of demand pressure to price inflation, and, given the uncertainty about NAIRU, on readings of the current inflation rate.",LABEL_0,0.9939209222793579
