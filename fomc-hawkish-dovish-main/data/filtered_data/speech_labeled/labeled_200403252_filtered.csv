53,"The incoming data contain some indications that underlying inflation is no longer declining, but the evidence is inconclusive thus far.",LABEL_0,0.9911651015281677
54,"In particular, recent monthly changes in core prices have been within the range of increases seen in 2003, but this flattening out of inflation has not persisted long enough to be clearly distinguished from the normal volatility in these data.",LABEL_2,0.9574729204177856
55,"Still, if aggregate demand and potential aggregate supply follow the paths that I outlined earlier, the slack in resource utilization should diminish, unit labor costs should begin to move higher, and the underlying rate of inflation should stabilize.",LABEL_2,0.9988848567008972
56,Sources of potential upward pressure on prices have become more prominent in recent months.,LABEL_0,0.9814467430114746
57,Overall inflation has been boosted by a jump in energy prices.,LABEL_0,0.9659497737884521
58,Such a jump could raise core inflation temporarily if it is passed through to other prices or if it contributes to increasing inflation expectations.,LABEL_1,0.938637912273407

60,"However, futures market participants have priced in some decline in energy prices from these elevated levels; and even if energy prices remain high, they would not be adding to inflation over time.",LABEL_1,0.9872165322303772
61,Another factor some observers have cited as possibly boosting inflation is a tendency for increases in resource utilization to generate bottlenecks that can push up some prices more rapidly.,LABEL_2,0.9996030926704407
62,"Indeed, periods like the current one with rising global demand have often been accompanied by marked accelerations in the prices of crude and, to a lesser extent, intermediate materials, which seem to be most sensitive to changes in demand.",LABEL_2,0.9995588660240173
63,But this variation in upstream producer prices has left little imprint on consumer prices in the past--perhaps because these inputs account for a small share of the final value of industrial output and even less of total consumption.,LABEL_1,0.9989206790924072
64,A related concern is the effect of a declining dollar on import prices and the prices of competing domestic goods.,LABEL_1,0.9992749094963074
65,"Over time, however, foreign producers seem to be absorbing a greater share of the impact of a falling dollar in their profit margins rather than passing it on fully in their prices, and I expect the drop in the dollar to have only a modest effect on U.S. inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9992290735244751
66,"At the same time, other forces are likely to be acting to restrain inflation.",LABEL_1,0.999235987663269
67,"In addition, because hourly compensation has lagged productivity, unit labor costs have fallen markedly.",LABEL_1,0.9996098875999451
68,"The resulting markup of prices over unit labor costs is quite elevated, further encouraging firms to reach for market share as well as providing scope for workers' real wages to rise without pushing up inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9206336140632629
69,"Overall, the tenor of the inflation outlook has shifted over recent quarters.",LABEL_2,0.978925883769989
70,"Solid growth in economic activity, higher prices in some sectors, and hints of the stabilization of overall inflation, along with perceptions by businesses that ""pricing power"" may be returning, are marking a transition from asymmetric risks of additional disinflation to more nearly balanced risks of rising and falling inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9994144439697266
71,This transition is another key piece of the backdrop for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9371077418327332
72,"Monetary Policy Strategy As I noted at the outset of my talk, the federal funds rate is quite low: It is low relative to interest rates associated in the past with sustained high employment and stable prices; and it is low relative to recent rates of economic growth--a disparity that has attracted increasing attention from some observers.",LABEL_2,0.9997969269752502
73,"In fact, the low funds rate has been necessary to promote growth that, to date, has been just sufficient to begin reducing substantial margins of slack in resource utilization.",LABEL_1,0.7907216548919678
74,"Still, as my analysis indicates, the unusual shocks that have impinged on demand and bolstered potential supply over the past several years are abating, or should soon do so.",LABEL_2,0.5077071785926819
75,"As the output gap closes, economic stability will require that interest rates eventually move up from unusually low levels if we are to preserve price stability.",LABEL_0,0.8350554704666138

77,"As I have already noted, a considerable gap exists today between actual and potential output, and consumer price inflation is very low.",LABEL_1,0.7018148303031921
78,"In addition, the transitions I have discussed in aggregate demand, potential aggregate supply, and inflation are gradual processes.",LABEL_2,0.9996902942657471
79,The move to solid growth of demand and some easing in the growth of potential supply are unlikely to lead to a rapid closing of the gaps in resource utilization or a marked rise in inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9987239241600037
80,"Given our uncertainty about the rate of growth of potential supply, actually observing a closing output gap will be particularly important for policymakers.",LABEL_2,0.9998180270195007
81,"Given our uncertainty about the level of potential supply and thus the level of the output gap, observing stable inflation will also be particularly important.",LABEL_0,0.9837260842323303
82,"Moreover, the low current levels of inflation and resource utilization imply, from my perspective, that the welfare costs of the economy running stronger than expected for a while are considerably lower than the costs of its running weaker.",LABEL_0,0.9302894473075867
83,"In these circumstances, I think policy action can await convincing evidence that labor market slack is on a declining trend and that inflation is no longer decreasing.",LABEL_0,0.8089905977249146
84,"They are concerned that continued policy accommodation is distorting interest rates and asset prices and encouraging a build-up of debt, and thereby laying the groundwork for financial and economic instability.",LABEL_2,0.9941664934158325
85,"Clearly, the low funds rate has held down long-term interest rates and boosted asset prices.",LABEL_1,0.9939538836479187
86,"These movements are, in fact, some of the key channels through which monetary policy has stimulated demand.",LABEL_2,0.9949142932891846
87,Whether prices in some markets have gone beyond what one might have expected from easier monetary policy is unclear.,LABEL_0,0.9985772371292114
88,"When interest rates increase, prices will undoubtedly adjust to some extent--in some cases simply by rising less rapidly than they would otherwise--and debt-service obligations will move up.",LABEL_2,0.9996159076690674
89,"But I think the hurdle is high--and appropriately so--for a central bank to tighten policy, and in the process damp an expansion of economic activity in the short run, on the suspicion that movements in asset prices and increases in debt threaten economic stability over the longer run.",LABEL_2,0.7222924828529358
