2,"September 27, 2007 Globalization, Macroeconomic Performance, and Monetary Policy Governor Frederic S. Mishkin At the Domestic Prices in an Integrated World Economy Conference, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. Share In recent years, globalization has become one of the hottest topics, not only for the general public but also for central bankers.1 Some commentators have gone so far as to claim that greater openness of economies to flows of goods, services, capital, and businesses from other nations invalidate traditional economic models of inflation, which take little account of globalization.",LABEL_2,0.9998332262039185

6,I will look at each in turn and will then use the analysis to address another important issue for monetary policy makers: Has globalization been a key driver of improvements in inflation performance and the decline in inflation that we have been seeing throughout the world?,LABEL_2,0.9553490877151489

10,"Kenneth Rogoff (2003) argues that globalization has led to greater price flexibility, which has reduced the ability of central banks to use inflation surprises to boost output.",LABEL_2,0.9987488985061646
11,"In other words, the Phillips curve will steepen, making more stark the short-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9996064305305481
12,"As a result, central banks will be less tempted to try to exploit the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, as in the Barro-Gordon (1983) model, and so will be less likely to pursue overly expansionary monetary policy that leads to higher inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9993494153022766
13,"A major problem with Rogoff's argument is that instead of steepening with the growth of globalization in recent years, the Phillips curve has become flatter, not only in the United States but also in many other countries throughout the world (Borio and Filardo, 2007; International Monetary Fund, 2006; Ihrig and others, 2007; Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).",LABEL_1,0.8190961480140686

23,"Research at the Federal Reserve Board by Kamin, Marazzi, and Schindler (2006) estimates that purchases of manufactures from China have lowered U.S. import price inflation roughly 1 percentage point annually over the past decade, a decline that has led to a short-run lowering of consumer price inflation of about one-tenth of 1 percentage point and a somewhat larger effect over the longer term.",LABEL_2,0.9989966750144958
24,"Research at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) by Pain, Koske, and Sollie (2006) arrives at a similar estimate of the effect of trade in manufactures with developing countries on U.S. inflation: negative 0.2 to negative 0.3 percentage point.",LABEL_2,0.9885518550872803

28,"Analysis by the Board's staff, which weights the negative effect on U.S. inflation from cheaper manufactures against the positive effect from higher commodity prices, finds that the net effect in recent years could go either way but in any case is probably quite small.",LABEL_1,0.9995468258857727
29,"Looking back before the recent boom in commodities prices, the staff's best estimate is that China's and India's entrance on the global trading scene has had a small negative effect on inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9984114170074463

31,"Following the argument made by Milton Friedman (Friedman, 1974), Ball points out that for every decline in the relative price of one good or service in a price index like the consumer price index (CPI), there is by definition a rise in the relative price of some other good or service.",LABEL_2,0.9997274279594421
32,Any pattern of relative-price changes is compatible with a particular level of the inflation rate.,LABEL_2,0.9993170499801636

34,Ball therefore takes the view that cheap imports from China and other low-wage economies should not affect inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9998148083686829
35,I would not go as far as Ball does for the reason that changes in relative prices in an important category of goods and services could affect inflation for a considerable period of time.,LABEL_1,0.9635785222053528
36,"Nevertheless, his argument, as well as the research cited earlier, indicates that many of the exaggerated claims that globalization has been an important factor in lowering inflation in recent years just do not hold up.",LABEL_2,0.9997966885566711
37,It is thus of concern to monetary policy makers because it can affect both output volatility and our forecasts of the economy.,LABEL_2,0.999170184135437
38,"Research at the Federal Reserve Board (Ihrig and others, 2007) documents that net exports tend to be negatively correlated with domestic demand and thus stabilize output; other research (Guerrieri, Gust, and López-Salido, 2007) finds that shocks to domestic demand move output less in more open economies.",LABEL_2,0.9997510313987732

40,"Globalization and the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Four questions naturally arise when we consider whether globalization has changed the monetary transmission mechanism, that is, how monetary policy influences inflation and output: (1) Has globalization led to a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic output gaps (the difference between actual and potential output) and thus to domestic monetary policy?",LABEL_2,0.9997560381889343
41,"(2) Are foreign output gaps playing a more prominent role in the domestic inflation process, so that domestic monetary policy has more difficulty stabilizing inflation?",LABEL_2,0.9990314245223999

45,"In recent years, we have clearly witnessed a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to the domestic output gap (a flattening of the Phillips curve) in the United States and other advanced countries (Borio and Filardo, 2007; International Monetary Fund, 2006; Ihrig and others, 2007; Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).",LABEL_2,0.499784916639328

47,"Although this story is a plausible one, research at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere finds no evidence that the flattening of the Phillips curve reflects the process of increasing trade integration (Ihrig and others, 2007; Ball, 2006; Wynne and Kersting, 2007).2 Rather than globalization being an important factor leading to flatter Phillips curves, I would argue (as in Mishkin, 2007a) that flatter Phillips curves are the direct result of better monetary policy that has anchored inflation expectations.",LABEL_1,0.6185867786407471
48,"Because monetary authorities are focusing more on establishing a stronger nominal anchor, a rise in resource utilization will not lead to a rise in expected inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9544030427932739
49,"Instead, households and businesses will expect monetary authorities to take the necessary steps to ensure that the economy will not overheat, and, as a result, they will not push for higher prices and wages.",LABEL_2,0.9995800852775574
50,"Not only is this explanation for decreased sensitivity of inflation to output gaps more consistent with empirical evidence (see Mishkin, 2007a; Roberts, 2006), but it is more consistent with the timing of when Phillips curves became flatter.",LABEL_2,0.9992913007736206
51,"In the United States, Phillips curves started to flatten in the 1980s, well before the recent surge of globalization but just after inflation expectations started to become anchored.",LABEL_2,0.8066728711128235

55,"Using more-conventional specifications of Phillips curves, the research at the Federal Reserve Board (Ihrig and others, 2007) and the OECD (Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006), as well as Ball (2006), finds that foreign output gaps are not important determinants of domestic inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9913474917411804

58,"Indeed, CPI inflation does appear to have become more sensitive to import prices over time, both in the United States and in other OECD countries (Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).3 Can domestic monetary policy still control domestic interest rates and so stabilize both inflation and output?",LABEL_1,0.9750077724456787
59,"In principle, the increasing global integration of financial markets, by reducing the scope for individual central banks to control domestic interest rates, could hamper the ability of monetary policy to stabilize prices and economic activity.",LABEL_2,0.9994972944259644
60,"Indeed, some evidence appears to suggest that foreign factors influence interest rates; for example, the global saving glut does seem to have led to somewhat lower long-term interest rates by reducing term premiums (Warnock and Warnock, 2006).",LABEL_2,0.9687625765800476

68,The resulting decrease in net exports implies a reduction in aggregate demand.,LABEL_2,0.9998119473457336

72,"In addition, the larger the share of imports in the economy, the larger should be the effect on overall CPI inflation of a given change in import prices when the exchange rate changes.4 (This effect is explicitly incorporated in Federal Reserve staff models of U.S. inflation, which weight import prices by the share of imports in the consumption basket.)",LABEL_2,0.9998083710670471
73,"By the same token, the effect of the interest rate channel on overall economic activity may be diminished by greater trade integration as changes in domestic demand are offset by induced changes in imports.",LABEL_1,0.9660688638687134
