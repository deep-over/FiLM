0,"Rather than grapple with the definition of the rather slippery concept of liquidity in my short remarks here, I will focus on aspects of global financial markets that many analysts associate with liquidity and that are particularly relevant for monetary policy--namely, the relatively low level of long-term interest rates in both real and nominal terms and the resulting relatively flat slope of yield curves around the world.1 I want to emphasize that, given the openness of capital markets, explanations of these phenomena should have an international component.",LABEL_2,0.8512787222862244
1,"I will argue that the flatness of the term structure reflects both the global balance of saving and investment, through its effect on real interest rates, and currency competition, through its effect on expected inflation and inflation risk.",LABEL_2,0.9989652633666992
2,We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.,LABEL_2,0.9998375177383423
3,"To abstract from the potential effects of cyclical factors on the yield curve, consider the pattern of forward rates many years into the future, at which point the effects of current cyclical shocks would be expected to no longer be important.2 Such forward rates reflect not only market expectations of future short-term interest rates but also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9995651841163635
4,"The resulting strength of demand has kept real long-term interest rates lower than they might otherwise have been in many countries, and particularly in the United States because it is a relatively attractive place to invest.",LABEL_2,0.9986153841018677
5,"I will emphasize three significant changes in most countries around the world that point to a reduction in the compensation required by investors for the possible effects of future inflation on the returns to holding long-term bonds: Namely, declines in (1) actual inflation, (2) inflation volatility, and (3) expectations of long-term inflation, both survey based and ""market based.""",LABEL_0,0.9992287158966064
6,"What I have elsewhere referred to as ""currency competition"" may be a driving force behind these changes in inflation outcomes and expectations and may be reflected in low nominal long-term interest rates and the flattening of yield curves.5 Iâ€™d like to briefly review what I mean by currency competition.",LABEL_2,0.9987894892692566
7,"A confluence of four factors--deregulation, globalization, financial innovation, and the publicâ€™s increased understanding of the costs of inflation--has fostered a form of competition among currencies.",LABEL_0,0.9980475902557373
8,"That competition, in turn, has led to improved central bank performance and thereby contributed to the recent conquest of worldwide inflation.",LABEL_1,0.8889832496643066
9,"Prompted in part by the collapse of central planning, many countries have turned increasingly to private markets and trade to deliver growth and progress.",LABEL_1,0.8862856030464172
10,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.",LABEL_2,0.999396562576294
11,"Almost everywhere, public opinion eventually turned against allowing inflation to continue.",LABEL_1,0.933199405670166
12,This public pressure has reinforced the trend against inflationary policies.,LABEL_1,0.9909244179725647
13,"Increased competition among currencies, driven by the confluence of factors that I just described, has improved central bank performance by changing the ability and the incentives of governments and central banks to pursue high-inflation policies.",LABEL_1,0.9957976341247559
14,"In effect, currency competition has raised the costs of poor policy and thus promoted central bank incentives to maintain low inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9995110034942627
15,This change has led many governments to be more willing to adopt institutional changes to improve central bank governance that have bolstered central bank credibility for maintaining low inflation.,LABEL_1,0.9993584752082825
16,"Such changes have included greater central bank independence, which has typically been granted in conjunction with a mandate including the achievement of low and stable inflation as one of the goals of monetary policy.",LABEL_1,0.9986263513565063
17,"When citizens are more aware of the costs of inflation, and when governments are less able to reap benefits from high inflation, institutional reforms that make central banks more credible and independent are more likely to be adopted and sustained.7 Let me make it clear that I think that currency competition has been a much larger force in emerging-market economies, in which the costs of poor policies have been demonstrated quite clearly, than in advanced economies.",LABEL_2,0.6896092891693115
18,The forces behind currency competition that have bolstered incentives for central banks to maintain low inflation and so have helped anchor inflation expectations are likely to persist and perhaps strengthen.,LABEL_1,0.6034533977508545
