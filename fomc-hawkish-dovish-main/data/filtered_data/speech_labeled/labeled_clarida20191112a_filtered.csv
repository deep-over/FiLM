0,I am pleased that this year the focus of the conference is on two of my long-standing professional interestsâ€”financial markets and monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9995123147964478
1,"In particular, I would like to address an issue that has been much in focusâ€”the decline in long-term interest ratesâ€”highlighting the role of monetary policy in contributing to that decline and the implications of that decline for the conduct of monetary policy.",LABEL_0,0.9929525256156921
2,The Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates and the Role of Monetary Policy One of the most remarkable and fundamental changes in the global financial landscape over the past three decades has been the steady and significant decline in global sovereign bond yields.,LABEL_0,0.9955936074256897
3,"To understand and interpret this decline, it is useful to think of the yield on a nominal 10-year bond as the sum of two components: investors' expectation over the next 10 years of the average level of short-term interest rates plus a term premium.",LABEL_2,0.9997232556343079
4,The term premium is the additional compensationâ€”relative to investing in and rolling over short-maturity billsâ€”that bondholders require for assuming the risk of holding a long-duration asset with greater exposure to interest rate and inflation volatility.,LABEL_2,0.9199762344360352
5,"In this case, which is relevant today in the United States and some other countries, the exposure to interest rate and inflation volatility embedded in a long-maturity bond is more than offset by the potential value of the bond in hedging other risks, such as equity risk.2 The expectation of the average level of future short-term interest rates can, in turn, be decomposed into the expectation of average future real interest rates and the expectation of average future inflation rates.",LABEL_2,0.9996678829193115
6,"Performing this standard decomposition reveals that the decline in long-term rates reflects declines in all three components: expected real rates, expected inflation, and the term premium (figure 2, ""Yield Decomposition"").",LABEL_2,0.891370952129364
7,"With respect to expected real short-term interest rates, one reason investors expect lower future short-term interest rates is that neutral interest rates appear to have declined worldwide and are expected to remain low.",LABEL_0,0.9979894161224365
8,This concept of a neutral level for short-term real interest rates is referred to in the academic literature as r* and corresponds to the rate consistent with a level of aggregate demand equal to and growing in pace with aggregate supply at an unchanged rate of inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9937955141067505
9,"Policymakers and academics alike, including myself, have spent considerable time exploring the reasons for and ramifications of the decline in r* across countries.3 For example, many have pointed to slowing population growth and a moderation in the pace of technological change as consistent with a lower level of r*.4 Changes in risk tolerance and regulations have led to an increase in savings and in the demand for safe assets, pushing down yields on sovereign bonds.5 Importantly, economic theory suggests and empirical research confirms that there is a significant common global component embedded in individual country r*s (figure 3, ""Estimates of r*"").6 This common factor driving individual country r*s not only reflects the influence of common global shocks affecting all economies in a similar way (for example, a slowdown in global productivity and the demographics associated with aging), but also results from international capital flows that respond to and, over time, tend to narrow divergences in rates of return offered across different countries.",LABEL_0,0.9961130619049072
10,"In addition to the decline in r* around the world, lower long-term bond yields also reflect the influence of the initial downshift and ultimate anchoring of inflation expectations in many countries after the mid-1990s.",LABEL_0,0.9981358051300049
11,"Unlike the decline in r*, which primarily reflects fundamental ""real"" factors that are outside the control of a central bank, the decline and ultimate anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations in both major and many emerging economies were the direct consequence of the widespread adoption and commitment to transparent, flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategies.",LABEL_1,0.9981537461280823
12,"For example, in the United States, after the collapse of Bretton Woods, inflation spiraled upward, hitting double-digit rates in the 1970s and early 1980s.",LABEL_1,0.998056173324585
13,"But by the mid-1980s, the back of inflation had been broken (thank you, Paul Volcker), and total personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation averaged less than 4 percent from 1985 to 1990.",LABEL_2,0.9014713168144226
14,"Following the 1990â€“91 recession, inflation fell further, and, by the mid-1990s, the conditions for price stability in the United States had been achieved (thank you, Alan Greenspan).",LABEL_2,0.6267305612564087
15,"From the mid-1990s until the Great Recession, U.S. PCE inflation averaged about 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9993614554405212
16,"And, of course, this step-down in inflation has been global, with the other major advanced economies experiencing a similar shift down (table 1, ""Average Inflation Rates"").",LABEL_0,0.6513575315475464
17,Many major emerging market economies as well have seen a remarkable and very welcome decline in average inflation rates as a result of adopting and delivering on credible inflation-targeting polices.,LABEL_1,0.9977383613586426
18,"To the extent that the step-down in inflation is expected to persist, which appears to be the case, long-term yields have reflected this decline one-for-one.",LABEL_0,0.996703565120697
19,"However, not only has the average level of inflation fallen, but inflation has also become more stable.",LABEL_0,0.9786729216575623
20,"After considerable volatility in the 1970s and 1980s, over the past few decades, inflationâ€”especially core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy pricesâ€”has, with rare exceptions, moved only within a relatively narrow range in many countries despite significant swings in the prices of oil and other commodities, recessions, the Global Financial Crisis, and unprecedented monetary policy actions.",LABEL_1,0.410715788602829
21,"Reflecting this, inflation volatility, as measured by the standard deviation in quarterly inflation rates, has declined.",LABEL_2,0.9996935129165649
22,"(See table 2, ""Standard Deviation of Annualized Quarterly Headline Inflation Rates."")",LABEL_2,0.4947267770767212
23,What has been behind this global decline in inflation volatility?,LABEL_2,0.9996680021286011
24,"I would argue, as have many others, that monetary policy played a key role in reducing not only the average rate of inflation, but also the volatility of inflation.7 Inflation-targeting monetary policy can plausibly influence the variance of inflation through several channels.",LABEL_1,0.4402278661727905
25,"For example, in a textbook DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (CGG), 1999) featuring a central bank that implements policy via a Taylor-type rule, the equilibrium variance of inflation will be lower the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target.",LABEL_1,0.6744515895843506
26,"So even if the variance of inflation shocks is constant, the variance of inflation itself will be an endogenous function of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9998058676719666
27,Another related channel through which monetary policy can influence the variance of inflation is by changing the equilibrium persistence of inflation deviations from target.,LABEL_1,0.9978591799736023
28,"In the textbook CGG model (1999), augmented with a hybrid Phillips curve that features an inertial backward-looking component, the equilibrium persistence of inflation is an endogenous function of the monetary policy rule such that the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target, the less persistent are inflation deviations from target in equilibrium.",LABEL_2,0.9996582269668579
29,"In the simple case in which equilibrium inflation is a first-order autoregressive process (as it is in the CGG (1999) model under optimal policy), the equilibrium unconditional variance of inflation is monotonic in inflation persistence for any given constant variance of inflation shocks.",LABEL_2,0.9996470212936401
30,"Of course, non-monetary factors may also have contributed to a lower variance of inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9040448069572449
31,"For example, the variance of underlying exogenous shocks to aggregate supply and demand may have fortuitously and coincidentally fallen in tandem with the adoption of inflation targeting in many countries.",LABEL_2,0.9995404481887817
32,"Decomposing the factors that drive equilibrium term premiums is an active area of academic research, and I will not attempt to summarize or synthesize this vast literature.8 But I would like to emphasize what seems to me to be three contributors to the decline in the term premium in the United States and perhaps in other countries as well.9 First, the decline in inflation volatility has almost certainly been important in driving the term premium on nominal bonds lower.",LABEL_2,0.9994310736656189
33,"The real ex-post payoff from holding a nominal bond to maturity is directly exposed to price-level risk, and thus, all else being equal, a decline in inflation volatility makes the real purchasing power of the bond's payoff less risky.",LABEL_2,0.9972430467605591
34,"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").",LABEL_0,0.918775737285614
35,"Indeed, this yield curve model attributes around 100 basis points of the decline in the U.S. 10-year nominal term premium since the early 1990s to a decline in the inflation risk premium.",LABEL_2,0.86390221118927
36,A third contributor to a lower U.S. term premium is much less widely appreciated than lower inflation volatility and LSAPs.,LABEL_1,0.52900230884552
37,"As such, we would expect the equilibrium yield on bonds to be lower than otherwise, as investors should bid up their price to reflect their value as a hedge against equity risk (relative to their value when the bond beta to stocks was positive).",LABEL_2,0.9922214150428772
38,"This paper develops and estimates a habit persistence consumption asset pricing model in which the sign of the equilibrium covariance between equity and bond returns depends on the reduced-form correlation between inflation and the output gap, the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap, as well as the equilibrium persistence of inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9014037251472473
39,"CPV document in U.S. data, for a sample spanning 1979:Q3 to 2011:Q4, that (1) the correlation between inflation and the output gap changed sign from negative to positive; that (2) the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap changed sign, also from negative to positive; and that (3) the evidence of the sign change becomes statistically significant beginning in the late 1990s.",LABEL_0,0.8751896619796753
40,CPV also document that the transitory component of inflation becomes much less persistent after the estimated break in their sample.,LABEL_2,0.9998619556427002
41,"The CPV paper is agnostic as to why the reduced-form correlation between inflation and the output gap and that between the federal funds rate and the output gap both change sign in their sample, but the authors do demonstrate that in their asset pricing model, these reduced-form sign changes are sufficient to generate the sign change in the correlation between equity and bond returns that we observe in the data.",LABEL_2,0.9997020363807678
42,"I, myself, believe that the change in the U.S. monetary policy regime that began in 1979 under Paul Volcker and that was extended by Alan Greenspan in the 1990s very likely contributed to the change in the sign of the correlation between inflation and the output gap as well as the change in sign of the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap that we observe in the data (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 2000).",LABEL_2,0.9997466206550598
43,"These are the sorts of patterns that a simple model of optimal monetary policy would produce when starting from an initial condition in which inflation is well above the (implicit) target, as was the case in 1979.",LABEL_2,0.9998478889465332
44,"High initial inflation triggers a policy response for the central bank to push up the real policy rate well above inflation in order to push output below potential, which, via the Phillips curve, will, over time, lower inflation toward the target.",LABEL_2,0.9995144605636597
45,"If this policy succeeds ex post, inflation expectations become anchored at the new lower level of inflation, and policy can, then, respond to demand shocks by adjusting real rates pro-cyclically, the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and inflation expectations are not anchored.13 Inflation will also be pro-cyclical with well-anchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate and inflation expectations remain anchored.",LABEL_1,0.5367540717124939
46,"Implications for Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve's Framework Review By lowering expected inflation, by anchoring expected inflation at a low level, by contributing to a reduction in the volatility of inflationâ€”and thus a reduction in the inflation risk premiumâ€”and by contributing to creating a hedging value of long-duration sovereign bonds, inflation-targeting monetary policy has lowered equilibrium bond yields relative to equilibrium short rates substantially compared with the experience of the 1970s and early 1980s.",LABEL_1,0.9993482232093811
47,But what does this mean for monetary policy?,LABEL_2,0.9934040904045105
48,"The reality of low neutral rates and equilibrium bond yields has motivated us at the Federal Reserve to take a hard look this year at our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.",LABEL_1,0.567084550857544
49,"The first question is, ""Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?""",LABEL_2,0.9997534155845642
50,Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots.,LABEL_0,0.837670624256134
51,"But persistent inflation shortfalls, such as those associated with the ELB, carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.16 At our September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, we discussed options for mitigating ELB risks, including ""makeup"" strategies in which policymakers would promise to make up for past inflation shortfalls with a sustained accommodative stance of policy intended to generate higher future inflation.17 Such strategies provide accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate low for an extended period.",LABEL_2,0.9959806203842163
52,Makeup strategies may also help anchor inflation expectations more firmly at 2 percent than would a policy strategy that does not compensate for past inflation misses.,LABEL_1,0.9425197839736938
53,"We are also considering whether our existing monetary policy tools are adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or whether our toolkit should be expanded and, if so, how.",LABEL_0,0.9945042133331299
54,One of these challenges is how best to conduct monetary policy in the new world of low equilibrium interest rates.,LABEL_2,0.9996392726898193
55,"Stepping back, earlier today, speakers at this conference discussed the challenges of making monetary policy in an uncertain and risky environment.",LABEL_1,0.9322414994239807
