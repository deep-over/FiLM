52,"Demand, it appears, received an additional boost over this period from a run-up in equity prices that the higher productivity growth alone could not fully account for.",LABEL_0,0.9559683799743652
53,"The balance between supply and demand can be inferred from movements in utilization rates, specifically in the unemployment rate.",LABEL_2,0.9996387958526611
54,"When actual output is expanding at the same pace as potential, the unemployment rate will be stable.",LABEL_2,0.9971128702163696
55,"When output growth outpaces the growth of potential, the unemployment rate declines.",LABEL_2,0.6365556120872498
56,And the unemployment rate has declined almost 0.4 percentage points a year for the past four years.,LABEL_0,0.9006496071815491
57,This translates into excess demand growth of 0.75 to 1 percentage point relative to potential supply growth.,LABEL_1,0.7128173112869263
58,The second insight--and enduring old economy wisdom--is that a proximate source of changes in inflation is an imbalance between the levels of aggregate supply and aggregate demand.,LABEL_2,0.9245817065238953
59,This can be expressed as an imbalance between actual and potential output or as a divergence of the unemployment rate from the NAIRU.,LABEL_2,0.9978797435760498

71,These two types of shocks give rise to different challenges for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.999782383441925
72,Supply shocks come in two varieties: relative price shocks (such as changes in the relative price of oil) and productivity shocks.,LABEL_2,0.9997193217277527

84,A Brief Inflation Report But is there any evidence that inflation pressures are in fact building?,LABEL_1,0.9994366765022278
85,"Of course, overall inflation has clearly increased significantly over the last year.",LABEL_2,0.7270352244377136
86,"The consumer price index, for example, has increased at a 3 percent rate over the last twelve months, compared with a 2.3 percent rate over the previous twelve months.",LABEL_1,0.999293327331543
87,Similar trends are evident in the PCE and in the GDP price index.,LABEL_1,0.991411566734314
88,But this increase in overall inflation reflects mainly the rise in oil prices over 1999 and into 2000.,LABEL_2,0.9996486902236938
89,"Assuming that oil prices stabilize, the effect will dissipate, and overall inflation will return toward, and indeed dip slightly below, the core rate (the rate net of food and energy prices).",LABEL_1,0.9989197254180908
90,"So, looking forward, the core inflation rate is the more important consideration.",LABEL_2,0.9908652901649475
91,These numbers suggest that inflation pressures remain well contained.,LABEL_2,0.9993510842323303
92,"But digging a little deeper, the evidence, in my judgment, supports the conclusion that core inflation has moved modestly higher over the last six to nine months.",LABEL_1,0.9351804852485657
93,"First, the introduction of a methodological change in measuring the CPI in January 1999 lowered CPI inflation relative to the earlier period.",LABEL_1,0.9995366334915161
94,"As a result, on a methodologically consistent basis, core CPI inflation in the last twelve months has actually been up a couple tenths of a percentage point.",LABEL_2,0.9872101545333862
95,"But, more important, the higher-frequency data provides some evidence of a rising trend in core inflation.",LABEL_1,0.5223192572593689
96,"For example, at an annual rate, core CPI inflation is 2.4 percent over the last nine months, 2.5 percent over the last six months and 3.2 percent over the last three months.",LABEL_1,0.9994402527809143
97,So I conclude that the underlying trend for core CPI inflation has moved up to close to 2-1/2 percent today.,LABEL_1,0.815191924571991
98,The core PCE and the GDP price indexes also have accelerated over the last six to nine months.,LABEL_1,0.9992457628250122
99,The higher core inflation could be explained by a pass-through to the core of earlier increases in oil prices.,LABEL_1,0.9959994554519653
100,"However, whether such a pass-through leads to a one-time increase in the price level or to continuing inflation depends on whether or not monetary policy accommodates the higher inflation.",LABEL_1,0.998917818069458
101,"Whether such accommodation occurs, in turn, depends on how policy deals with the excess demand that will be felt in the first instance in wage pressures in a very tight labor market.",LABEL_1,0.9994367957115173

104,"Until the May employment report, the recent monthly data clearly pointed to an acceleration in average hourly earnings--given the 4-1/2 percent rate posted over the first four months of the year after a 3-1/2 percent rate over 1999.",LABEL_1,0.9915379285812378
105,"There are, in my judgment, some grounds for discounting the productivity and cost measure.",LABEL_2,0.9991835951805115
106,"Even if the evidence for an acceleration in nominal labor compensation were more definitive, the implications for inflation are not altogether straightforward.",LABEL_0,0.9938207268714905
107,"If the trend in the growth of labor compensation is upward, it could be a response to the uptick in overall inflation last year or to overly tight labor markets or to a catch-up to the higher rate of productivity growth.",LABEL_1,0.9976110458374023
108,"Just as the slowing in overall inflation in 1997 and 1998 contributed to a moderation in nominal wage demands, the higher overall inflation in 1999 and 2000 would be expected to boost nominal wage demands.",LABEL_2,0.9998388290405273
109,But any rebound in nominal labor compensation could also reflect a catch-up to higher productivity growth.,LABEL_2,0.5712456107139587
110,"If nominal compensation is just matching the higher productivity growth, this source of acceleration in nominal compensation would not itself be inflationary.",LABEL_1,0.9985699653625488
111,The slow initial response of nominal compensation to higher productivity growth is the source of the temporary disinflationary effect of a productivity shock.,LABEL_1,0.9989171028137207
112,"Therefore, once the catch-up is under way, this disinflationary impetus gradually disappears.",LABEL_0,0.9951150417327881
113,"And at this point, the pass-through from higher inflation and the effect of tight labor markets have no offset and will begin to dominate.",LABEL_1,0.9787319898605347
114,So even the catch-up story plays a role in the upward trend in inflation.,LABEL_0,0.5422086119651794
115,A second reason that nominal compensation is so difficult to factor into an inflation forecast is that compensation practices are changing.,LABEL_2,0.9776926636695862

121,"At some point, however, when the temporary disinflationary impetus of the favorable supply developments dissipate, not only will there be some rebound in inflation, but unless a transition is made back to sustainable utilization rates, there will be a risk of a continuous upward movement in inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9214272499084473
122,"During that transition, at least some of the earlier decline in core inflation will be reversed.",LABEL_2,0.9996447563171387

125,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,LABEL_0,0.43048346042633057
126,The major question in this respect is whether slowing the economy to trend alone will get the job done or whether we need a period of below-trend growth to unwind an imbalance between the levels of aggregate demand and supply.,LABEL_1,0.9992371797561646
127,"If the task is only slowing the economy to trend--because the NAIRU turns out to be close to 4 percent--the task is not as challenging, and inflation will remain stable near current levels.",LABEL_0,0.9926673769950867

129,"If successful, in either scenario, the payoff from monetary restraint will be both to contain the risk of higher inflation and to extend the life of this remarkable expansion.",LABEL_2,0.9995275735855103
130,"First, we are now in a high-growth rather than a low-growth economy.",LABEL_1,0.9995681643486023
131,"Even if we have to slow growth to below trend for a period, the resulting growth rate could remain well above the average growth rate over the previous 25 years and still get the job done.",LABEL_1,0.9964973330497742
132,"If oil prices have now at least peaked--and, better yet, if they decline at least modestly over the next year and a half, as suggested by expectations reflected in futures markets--the upward impetus to overall inflation from oil prices will dissipate or even reverse.",LABEL_2,0.9965094923973083
133,"In this case, overall inflation is likely to decline next year, and this decrease could help moderate the rise in core inflation into the following year.",LABEL_1,0.9990744590759277
