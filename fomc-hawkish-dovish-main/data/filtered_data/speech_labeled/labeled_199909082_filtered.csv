23,"First, monetary policy never should target a specific rate of growth in output but rather should adjust to changes in resource utilization rates and inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9762844443321228
24,This is because growth itself does not cause inflation; it is excessive utilization rates that are a proximate source of inflation pressures.,LABEL_2,0.9993302822113037

55,"An important issue therefore is whether current utilization rates are sustainable, once productivity growth stabilizes.",LABEL_1,0.9375402927398682
56,An overheated economy is one operating beyond the point of sustainable capacity and therefore experiencing excess demand in labor and product markets.,LABEL_0,0.9977349042892456
57,The importance of the concept follows from the reasonable expectation that excess demand in labor and product markets is a proximate source of higher inflation.,LABEL_1,0.6824889183044434
58,The first is to find some proxy for excess demand in labor and product markets.,LABEL_2,0.974337100982666
59,We have to satisfy ourselves with proxies because excess demand is not directly measurable.,LABEL_1,0.9929125905036926
60,"The second is to look for the consequences of overheating, in the form of acceleration in wage gains or prices.",LABEL_1,0.9993529915809631
61,Proxies for excess demand are utilization rates in the labor and product markets--such as the unemployment rate in the labor market and capacity utilization in the product market.,LABEL_2,0.9983950257301331
62,"Capacity utilization is measured only in the “industrial” sector, so it is a narrow measure of generalized excess demand in the product market.",LABEL_2,0.9994413256645203
63,"Nevertheless, it remains an important proxy for the balance of supply and demand in the product market.",LABEL_1,0.9990247488021851
64,"At any given time, a lower unemployment rate or higher capacity utilization rate implies greater demand relative to supply in the respective market.",LABEL_2,0.9993466734886169

66,"That’s the difficult part, because we observe only absolute unemployment and capacity utilization rates and have to estimate their respective “natural” rates, the levels consistent with balance between supply and demand in the respective markets.",LABEL_2,0.9997217059135437
67,"The less stable they are, the more uncertainty we will have at any point about the underlying degree of excess demand.",LABEL_1,0.6469305157661438

70,"Second, the signals about excess demand coming from labor and product markets--that is from unemployment and capacity utilization rates--have diverged to an unusual degree, making an assessment of the overall degree of excess demand in the economy still more difficult.",LABEL_2,0.9502976536750793
71,"Third, the economy has been subject to powerful price shocks in this episode--including significant swings in oil prices and exchange rates.",LABEL_2,0.9993739724159241

73,"Fourth, it appears that there has been an upturn in the productivity trend, which, as noted above, acts as a disinflationary force for a period of time, further masking underlying excess demand and further complicating the assessment of sustainable utilization rates.",LABEL_2,0.9989006519317627
74,"So, where does all this put us in terms of proxies for excess demand?",LABEL_2,0.9988277554512024
75,"We’re in an environment where reasonable people can disagree about whether or not there is currently excess demand in the economy and, given that uncertainty, whether or not we ought to use evidence based on estimates of excess demand directly in the conduct of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9769951105117798
76,It also puts a priority on developing a strategy that takes account of possible shifts in and uncertainty about both productivity growth and the NAIRU.,LABEL_0,0.9971541166305542
77,"Although it appears that there is excess demand in the labor market, its effect has been diminished by the combination of the absence of corresponding excess demand in the product markets, the residue of the long period of reinforcing favorable price shocks, and the force of the unexpected acceleration in trend productivity.",LABEL_2,0.9993676543235779
78,"As the favorable price shocks dissipate or reverse and once trend productivity growth stabilizes, there is a risk that excess demand in the labor market will put the economy on a path of rising inflation, unless growth slows enough to unwind the excess demand before inflation begins to move upward.",LABEL_2,0.9995843768119812
79,"Given the momentum in sales and expectations for a stronger pace of inventory building in the second half, the consensus is that growth will rebound in the second half to trend or above, though we have not yet seen the effects on spending of the rise in bond rates and the flattening of equity prices since the spring.",LABEL_2,0.9997884631156921
80,This should help to slow the growth of domestic demand.,LABEL_0,0.9930665493011475
81,"Although there is some risk that growth could remain above trend and therefore aggravate any initial excess demand, a major concern remains that the prevailing balance of supply and demand in the labor market might put upward pressure on inflation, even if growth slows to trend ahead.",LABEL_1,0.9996042847633362
82,Let me briefly comment on the second indicator of excess demand.,LABEL_1,0.6498393416404724

85,"Nominal wage increases have moderated since the middle of 1998, likely reflecting the decline in inflation associated with a combination of favorable supply shocks, including the unexpected increase in the productivity trend.",LABEL_2,0.8069199919700623
86,"Some of the most recent data suggest that the growth of nominal compensation is no longer declining, and there are hints in the data and in anecdotes that wage pressures may be building.",LABEL_1,0.9983298182487488
87,How should monetary policy respond to increasing utilization rates?,LABEL_2,0.9954187870025635
88,"Should real interest rates be held constant until utilization rates increase above some threshold, for example, or should real interest rates be more smoothly pro-cyclical, gradually increasing in response to rising utilization rates?",LABEL_0,0.9977080821990967
89,That is simply a question of what systematic policy response works best to promote the dual objectives of monetary policy: promoting price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment.,LABEL_1,0.99946528673172
90,"My judgment is that a regime in which there is a gradual, systematic pro-cyclical response of real interest rates is the one that produces the best trade-off between inflation and output variability.",LABEL_1,0.773287832736969

93,What I do want to share with you is how the equity market fits into my thinking about monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9996401071548462
94,"Most important, policymakers should reflect the higher value of equities in their forecasts for aggregate spending and adjust monetary policy as necessary to remain consistent with the broad objectives of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9996660947799683

104,Does prevailing uncertainty about the structure of the economy and the recent forecast errors diminish the ability of monetary policy to be preemptive?,LABEL_1,0.9982002973556519
105,But that does not mean that there cannot be a preemptive element in monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9997469782829285
