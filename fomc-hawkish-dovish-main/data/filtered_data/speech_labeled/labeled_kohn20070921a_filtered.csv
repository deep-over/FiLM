6,"Although a consensus has not formed on how much of the ""Great Moderation"" in the growth of real output can be attributed to monetary policy, everyone agrees that at least a portion of it can.",LABEL_0,0.9950736165046692
7,"The beliefs that David identifies are threefold: That market economies are inherently self-righting, that open economies perform best under flexible exchange rates, and that central bankers should focus on price stability as their long-run objective.",LABEL_2,0.9395611882209778

26,"Nor is this instruction unreasonable, in that the dual mandate has come to be interpreted as assigning us the responsibility for attaining price stability in the long run, which will bring with it maximum employment, and of being mindful of resource utilization in the succession of short runs that make up the long run.",LABEL_1,0.9901536107063293
27,"The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.",LABEL_2,0.9809473752975464
28,"As I said earlier, anchoring expectations has value, in that it makes planning easier, reduces resources spent on predicting and protecting against unexpected variations in nominal magnitudes, and grants a central bank greater scope to lean against fluctuations in output while keeping inflation contained.",LABEL_2,0.9998655319213867

40,"The action the Federal Open Market Committee took this Tuesday can be interpreted as the application of the third leg of my preferred policy triad, in that it was taken ""to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.""",LABEL_2,0.9990523457527161

47,"In the typical boom-bust cycle, asset prices tend to rise relatively gradually over a protracted period but fall sharply in a shorter stretch of time, which financial economists refer to as ""rising by the escalator and falling by the elevator.""",LABEL_2,0.9996932744979858
48,"Perhaps because those asset prices are important to spending, key macroeconomic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, exhibit a similar pattern.",LABEL_2,0.9998252987861633
