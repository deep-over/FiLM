6,"Before I continue, please note that the opinions I express here today are my own and not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1 In brief, I argue that globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, in part spurred by the experiences of high inflation in the 1980s, have fostered currency competition that has led to improved central bank performance and, hence, the recent reduction of worldwide inflation.",LABEL_2,0.8248660564422607
7,The increased competition among currencies has changed the ability and the incentives of governments and central banks to pursue high-inflation policies.,LABEL_1,0.9994358420372009
8,"Such changes have allowed improvements in central bank governance and credibility, thereby leading to better inflation outcomes, especially in many emerging-market economies.",LABEL_2,0.9052910804748535
9,"In addition, greater central bank credibility has allowed the development of long-term bond markets in many countries and flattened yield curves around the globe as concerns about future inflation risks have declined.",LABEL_0,0.980633556842804
10,The important issue is whether the reduction of worldwide inflation will persist or be a temporary phenomenon.,LABEL_1,0.5775612592697144
11,"The Worldwide Decline in Inflation From the 1950s until the late 1960s, inflation rates were relatively contained, and episodes of high inflation were rare.",LABEL_2,0.99916672706604
12,"Then, especially following the early-1970s collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange-rate system, inflation became a worldwide phenomenon.",LABEL_1,0.9982823133468628

19,The April 2007 issue forecasts inflation in both regions to remain near these recent lows through 2008.,LABEL_2,0.996924102306366
20,But is this lower inflation regime likely to persist?,LABEL_0,0.6196035742759705
21,One way to approach this issue is to investigate what market participants think by examining measures of expected inflation.,LABEL_2,0.9998468160629272
22,"Overall, these surveys suggest that market participants do expect relatively low inflation to continue in most major industrial and emerging-market countries.",LABEL_2,0.579287588596344
23,"In the industrial countries and a few Asian emerging-market economies, for example, long-term inflation expectations dropped below 5 percent a decade or more ago and are currently around 2 percent to 3 percent.4 In Brazil and Mexico, long-term inflation expectations have declined from a range of 7 percent to 10 percent a decade ago to a fairly steady 3 percent to 4 percent in recent years.",LABEL_2,0.9978809952735901

30,"In understanding the key factors behind this change, we can also shed further light on the question of whether this low-inflation regime will persist.",LABEL_0,0.7601489424705505
31,"In a nutshell, I believe that the factors of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, arising partly in response to episodes of high inflation, have effectively eroded the central bank monopoly on the provision of monetary services and have enhanced global competition among currencies.",LABEL_2,0.9770957231521606
32,"The resulting constraint on monetary policy, combined with increased public understanding of the costs of inflation, have led to institutional changes in central bank governance that bolster their credibility for maintaining price stability in the future.",LABEL_1,0.9992183446884155
33,"To develop this explanation in more detail, I will start by describing how globalization, deregulation, and innovation can alter the ability and incentives of a government to pursue a high-inflation policy.6 These factors are closely related and mutually reinforcing in many respects.",LABEL_1,0.9175698757171631
34,Many countries have turned increasingly to private markets and trade to deliver growth and progress.,LABEL_2,0.9993181228637695

36,"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.",LABEL_1,0.999207079410553
37,This loss of value is also known as the inflation tax.,LABEL_1,0.9955436587333679
38,"Globalization, deregulation, and innovation make it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in the domestic currency should their government resort to an inflation tax.",LABEL_2,0.975484311580658
39,"When the tax base shrinks in response to inflation, governments have a reduced incentive to resort to the inflation tax.",LABEL_2,0.9946020841598511
40,Increased circulation of banknotes in dollars or other hard currencies enable citizens to conduct transactions and store liquid wealth without holding inflationary currency.,LABEL_0,0.6412134766578674
41,"The fraction of U.S. currency estimated to be held in foreign countries rose dramatically over the 1980s and 1990s, from less than 20 percent to about 60 percent, and it has remained near this high level even as inflation rates have come down globally.",LABEL_0,0.6201983094215393
42,"Substantial financial innovations--including advances in electronic payment and trading systems as well as more widespread credit card networks and increased use of mutual funds--have enabled consumers, investors, and banks to shift wealth cheaply and quickly away from currencies and assets subject to inflation and related risks.",LABEL_2,0.9974417686462402
43,"Given the stronger competition among currencies, a government that pressures a central bank to pursue an inflationary policy gets much less benefit from increased inflation because people can more rapidly and conveniently switch out of the domestic currency.",LABEL_1,0.777763307094574
44,"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.",LABEL_2,0.9950224161148071
45,"It states that, ""Prior to the mid-1990s [when inflation was stabilized], changes in the payment system in Brazil were motivated by the need to cope with high inflation rates.",LABEL_2,0.995482325553894
46,"7 In addition to encouraging financial innovation, the painful experience of high inflation helped to educate the public and economists about the costs of inflation.8 Although the specific experiences differed across countries, public opinion almost everywhere eventually reinforced the trend against inflationary policies.",LABEL_1,0.9958369731903076
47,"Economists and central bankers also devoted great attention to understanding the causes and consequences of inflation, providing the intellectual underpinning to policies oriented toward price stability.",LABEL_2,0.9335468411445618
48,"The fundamental forces I have described today--globalization, deregulation, financial innovation, and public understanding about the costs of inflation--provided the impetus for fighting inflation and opened the path for policies that enhance central bank credibility.",LABEL_1,0.9989206790924072
49,"As the benefits of stable prices accrue and as financial markets deepen and become more sophisticated, the benefits of sound economic policies will help create support for institutional reforms that make returning to inflation harder--albeit not impossible--for future governments.",LABEL_1,0.993800699710846
50,Implications of Low Inflation for Bond Markets What are the implications of low inflation and low inflation volatility for interest rates and yield curves?,LABEL_2,0.8966218829154968
51,I believe that market confidence in continued low inflation has helped drive down the slope of the yield curve around the world by reducing the premium demanded for holding long-term nominal assets.,LABEL_0,0.9896631836891174
52,"The taming of inflation also has extended bond maturities and yield curves further into the future than ever before, most notably in many emerging-market countries.",LABEL_0,0.9968761205673218
53,"The current low level of long-term yields in the United States and other advanced economies is widely acknowledged as somewhat of a puzzle, or, as some have called it, a conundrum.9 Of course, flat and even inverted yield curves in advanced economies are nothing new--we know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.",LABEL_2,0.7426061630249023
54,"The forward rate reflects not only the market expectation of the future short-term interest rate but also a ""term premium"" to compensate for the risk of a commitment to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9997219443321228
55,"Chairman Bernanke has suggested that an excess of ex ante global saving relative to global investment has held down real interest rates around the world.11 Some of the factors behind this excess of saving over investment include the surge in revenues of oil and commodity exporters, a retreat in Asian investment demand from the boom that preceded the late 1990s, and a reduction in fiscal deficits in some Latin American countries.",LABEL_2,0.9988766312599182
56,"The declines in inflation rates, in the volatility of inflation, and in long-term inflation expectations all point to a reduction in the compensation required by investors for the effects of future inflation on the returns to holding long-term bonds.",LABEL_0,0.9988299012184143
57,"This development is particularly remarkable in many emerging-market countries, in which longer-dated fixed-coupon bonds issued in domestic currencies had ceased to exist during the inflationary 1970s and 1980s.",LABEL_0,0.975851833820343
58,"The recent lengthening of maturities of domestic-currency debt has, in many cases, not only extended the yield curve but--and this is one of the key results of the taming of inflation--effectively created a domestic-currency yield curve that previously did not exist.",LABEL_2,0.9986119270324707
59,"Besides the fact that yield curves have been extended in many countries, they have also been relatively low and flat worldwide, at least in part because of the decline in inflation.",LABEL_0,0.5259796380996704
60,"Overall, the combination of lower and less volatile inflation worldwide has reduced inflation expectations and perceived inflation risk and resulted in a lower premium in long rates for inflation uncertainty.",LABEL_0,0.9926960468292236
61,The establishment of markets for long-term nominal government and corporate debt in countries in which they did not exist a decade ago is powerful evidence of the faith that investors place in a future environment of price stability.,LABEL_0,0.8010549545288086
62,Broader Economic Benefits The economic benefits of price stability are too numerous and well known for me to cover here in detail.,LABEL_1,0.9656768441200256

64,Price stability boosts growth by deepening financial markets.,LABEL_1,0.9986727237701416
65,"Given stable prices, savers and investors have more confidence about the ultimate value of their investments and are more willing to enter long-term financial contracts.",LABEL_2,0.5882095098495483
66,A number of studies have concluded that the development of banking and financial markets is a key driver of economic growth.,LABEL_1,0.9983317255973816
67,"When emerging-market countries borrowed mostly in dollars or other foreign currency, they bore the exchange rate risk while lenders bore default risk.",LABEL_2,0.999789297580719
68,This was a key reason why currency crises of the past few decades were so costly: Sharp depreciations of the exchange rate boosted the domestic-currency value of foreign debt and wreaked havoc with government finances and corporate balance sheets.,LABEL_2,0.9997716546058655
69,Higher and more-stable growth combined with a better ability to undertake long-term plans can also improve the fiscal outlook for a country.,LABEL_1,0.9505090117454529
70,"A better fiscal outlook, in turn, increases confidence, facilitates financial market development, and thus further boosts growth.",LABEL_2,0.8726485371589661
71,"And, in a virtuous cycle, it reinforces prospects for continued price stability.",LABEL_1,0.9817719459533691
72,"More-prudent fiscal policies, including lower deficits, longer debt maturities, and reduced foreign-currency debt can reduce the likelihood and potential severity of financial crises.",LABEL_1,0.9994388222694397
73,These policies make the financial positions of emerging-market governments less vulnerable to movements in interest rates and exchange rates.,LABEL_1,0.9540784358978271
74,"Maintaining Progress I have argued that globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, in part spurred by recent experiences of high inflation, have fostered currency competition that has led to improved central bank performance and, hence, the reduction of inflation worldwide.",LABEL_2,0.9996391534805298
75,"Barriers to the free flow of goods, services, capital, and technology would also diminish the force of innovation that has been so beneficial in the struggle against inflation.",LABEL_1,0.962574303150177
76,"High inflation can destroy an economy and result in enormous hardship for everyone involved, as Argentina painfully experienced not long ago.",LABEL_2,0.9876248836517334
