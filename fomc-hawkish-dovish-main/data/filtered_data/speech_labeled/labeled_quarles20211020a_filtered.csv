0,This morning I'd like to outline my view of current economic conditions and the economic outlook and then turn to the implications for monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9997864365577698
1,"In particular, with employment still well below its February 2020 peak, I will focus on how the escalation in inflation this year is testing the monetary policy framework adopted by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in August 2020.1 Outlook for Economic Growth Recent data suggest that growth in the third quarter is likely to be lower than we had expected, but the foundations remain in place for strong economic growth over the remainder of this year and next.",LABEL_2,0.459307461977005
2,"Employment is growing, financial conditions are accommodative, businesses are investing, and households, in the aggregate, have a large stock of savings to draw on for future spending.",LABEL_1,0.881305992603302
3,"Weaker growth in payrolls in August and September, along with uneven consumer spending in July and August, appear to reflect ongoing concerns in some parts of the country about the spread of COVID-19, especially in high-contact service industries.",LABEL_0,0.9970905780792236
4,"Supply bottlenecks and labor shortages that have been more widespread and persistent than many expected are camouflaging continued strong underlying demand for goods, services, and workers.",LABEL_0,0.9989272952079773
5,"I expect that these developments, however, have for the most part simply postponed activity temporarily and that robust growth will return in the coming months.",LABEL_1,0.9697054028511047
6,"The Labor Market Continues to Strengthen Without a doubt, the headline job gains in August and September were lower than expected, but, as I will show, based on almost every other major labor market indicator, there is ample evidence that the demand for labor is strong.",LABEL_2,0.9639738202095032
7,"Another indicator I've been watching closely is the so-called U-6 unemployment rate, which consists of people who are working part time but prefer full-time work and discouraged workers who want a job but have given up looking.",LABEL_1,0.9922230839729309
8,"U-6 unemployment declined significantly over the past two months to 8.5 percent in September, roughly the same level as in the middle of 2017, when most everyone considered the job market to be quite healthy.",LABEL_2,0.9949068427085876
9,"Strong demand for labor is outpacing supply, and, naturally, that development is putting upward pressure on wages.",LABEL_1,0.9193496704101562
10,"I noted the imbalance between the demand and supply for labor, and some of the labor market indicators that are still well short of pre-COVID levels are those related to labor force participation, which has been about unchanged this year on balance.",LABEL_1,0.9995884299278259
11,"One reason is that a disproportionate number of older workers responded to the initial shock of the COVID event by retiring, which may be an area where participation and employment struggle to retrace lost ground.",LABEL_0,0.7063058018684387
12,Longer-lasting changes in labor force participation could make wage pressures more persistent and have implications for the assessment of maximum employment.,LABEL_0,0.9940881729125977
13,"Tapering Asset Purchases Since the middle of last year, the Fed has been increasing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities by $120 billion a month to foster smooth market functioning and to support the economy by putting downward pressure on interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.989844560623169
14,"Conditions had improved considerably by the time we announced our forward guidance for asset purchases in December, but the unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent, near-term growth was being constrained by heightened social-distancing restrictions amid surging hospitalizations from COVID-19, and inflation was running significantly below 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9965164661407471
15,"As we sit here today, demand for labor is strong, and unemployment has declined to 4.8 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9970647692680359
16,"Inflation, about which I will say more shortly, is running at more than twice the FOMC's longer-run goal.",LABEL_1,0.9949784874916077
17,"Taking all of the evidence into account, I think it is clear that we have met the test of substantial further progress toward both our employment and our inflation mandates, and I would support a decision at our November meeting to start reducing these purchases and complete that process by the middle of next year.",LABEL_1,0.9995212554931641
18,"Bear in mind that asset purchases are pressing down on the accelerator, adding each month to the amount of accommodation the Fed is providing to the economy through downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.",LABEL_1,0.8786760568618774
19,"Monetary Policy When the Goals Are Not Complementary A move to reduce the pace of asset purchases soon also is entirely consistent with the FOMC's plan to pursue our longer-run maximum-employment and price-stability goals, and our new monetary policy strategy, which we refer to as our framework.",LABEL_0,0.9935239553451538
20,"Last December, with inflation running well below 2 percent and unemployment still elevated, we committed to continue purchasing assets at least at the current pace until we had made substantial further progress toward our goals.",LABEL_0,0.7493335604667664
21,"That is, high unemployment usually coincides with subdued inflationary pressures.",LABEL_0,0.9974972605705261
22,But we are facing a situation now where inflation is high even though employment has yet to fully recover from the COVID event.,LABEL_0,0.9981223940849304
23,"In that case, according to the FOMC's monetary policy framework, when objectives are not complementary, the Committee ""takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.",LABEL_1,0.9992009997367859
24,"Early on, patience was easy: In December of last year, my FOMC colleagues and I were expecting much lower inflationâ€”the median projection for 2021 by FOMC participants was 1.8 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9918409585952759
25,The FOMC's preferred inflation gauge did not crack 2 percent until March 2021.,LABEL_2,0.9997538924217224
26,"But, by June, prices had risen 4 percent over the previous 12 months, ticked up to 4.2 percent in July, and increased further to 4.3 percent in August.",LABEL_2,0.8869235515594482
27,The median of the most recent projections by FOMC participants traces a path in which inflation ends the year just a touch lower than the current level.,LABEL_2,0.9980641007423401
28,"Nonetheless, I do not see the FOMC as behind the curve, for three reasons: Most of the biggest drivers of the very high current inflation rates will ease in coming quarters, some measures of underlying inflation pressures are less worrisome, and longer-term inflation expectations are anchored, at least for now.",LABEL_1,0.9993975162506104
29,"First, let me address the big drivers of this year's price increases.",LABEL_0,0.8174386024475098
30,The inflation we have experienced so far has been very unusual and largely related to supply constraints associated both with production and distribution problems related to COVID and with a demand shock arising from the unprecedented and rapid reopening of the economy.,LABEL_1,0.9970707893371582
31,We all saw the remarkable price increases and shortages in the used car market.,LABEL_1,0.9987165927886963
32,"There have been a few other very specific and identifiable supply problems that have driven some other prices to very high levelsâ€”the semiconductor shortages that led to auto production slowdowns, for example, and, in some cases, labor shortages or restrictions related to the COVID event were associated with trade disruptions.",LABEL_1,0.9994195699691772
33,"Second, if we recognize that much of the excessive inflation we are seeing this year is directly attributable to disruptions that, like the COVID event, will end, then monetary policy often can look through those types of disruptions to consider what inflation will be in the future when this episode passes.",LABEL_1,0.9939659237861633
34,"To get a fix on where inflation is headed, it is helpful to consider measures of inflation that try to filter out the most unusual and presumably transitory price increases that may be driving headline inflation.",LABEL_1,0.995342493057251
35,"The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's trimmed mean measure of inflation systematically removes prices that are increasing or decreasing at abnormally large rates, in order to get some perspective on underlying inflation pressures.",LABEL_1,0.9480203986167908
36,"For the 12 months through August, the Dallas trimmed mean inflation was an even 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9993888139724731
37,"Of course, while this metric may provide a better indicator of future PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, I do not mean to suggest that this is necessarily a better reading on current inflationâ€”consumers and businesses have to pay for the goods whose prices have risen sharply, and those increases are being felt.",LABEL_2,0.9997817873954773
38,That brings us to the third reason that I do not think the FOMC is behind the curve: anchored inflation expectations.,LABEL_2,0.5884093642234802
39,We monitor longer-term expectations of future inflation because we believe they influence changes in actual inflation over the medium term.,LABEL_1,0.9988316893577576
40,"In fact, our new framework recognizes that stable, well-anchored inflation expectations help return inflation to 2 percent when it is running high, as it is now, as well as when it has fallen somewhat below that goal, as it often does during a recession.",LABEL_0,0.7207841873168945
41,"So far, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, as well as surveys of professional forecasters, have increased only moderately this year, moves that more or less reversed declines in those expectations over the previous half-dozen years.",LABEL_2,0.9998152852058411
42,"Measuring expectations is an inexact science, but smoothing through the ups and downs in expectations in recent years leaves these indicators within a range that has been consistent with inflation near our 2 percent goal.",LABEL_2,0.86534184217453
43,"Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months, but also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a concerning rise in longer-term inflation expectations.",LABEL_0,0.5969557166099548
44,I agree with my FOMC colleagues and most private forecasters that inflation likely will decline considerably next year from its currently very elevated rate.,LABEL_2,0.9998207688331604
45,"For instance, most of the September Summary of Economic Projections forecasts for PCE inflation in 2022 were between 1.9 and 2.3 percent, with a minimum of 1.7 percent and a maximum of 3.0 percent.3 But I see significant upside risks to my current inflation outlook.",LABEL_2,0.9994256496429443
46,"As noted earlier, labor supply constraints are making it difficult for businesses to keep up with demand.",LABEL_1,0.9993809461593628
47,"This dynamic will continue to support robust wage growth, putting further upward pressure on prices.",LABEL_1,0.9965589642524719
48,"Moreover, there is evidence in the past couple of months that a broader range of prices are beginning to increase at moderate rates, and I am closely watching those developments.",LABEL_1,0.8088943362236023
49,"The fundamental dilemma that we face at the Fed right now is this: Demand, augmented by unprecedented fiscal stimulus, has been outstripping a temporarily disrupted supply, leading to high inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9641491770744324
50,"But the fundamental productive capacity of our economy as it existed just before COVIDâ€”and, thus, the ability to satisfy that demand without inflationâ€”remains largely as it was, and the factors that are disrupting it appear to be transitory.",LABEL_1,0.9996542930603027
51,"Looked at purely in that light, constraining demand now, to bring it into line with a transiently interrupted supply, would be premature.",LABEL_1,0.9996302127838135
52,"Given the lags with which monetary policy acts, we could easily find that demand is damping just as supply is increasing, leading us to undershoot our inflation targetâ€”and, in the worst case, we could depress the incentives for supply to return, leading to an extended period of sluggish activity and unnecessarily low employment.",LABEL_1,0.9994416832923889
53,"Indeed, we are discovering that it's going to take more time than we had thought for supply to return to normal, and with demand already high during that time, I am monitoring the extent to which it could be further boosted by the additional fiscal programs currently under discussion.",LABEL_2,0.9807625412940979
54,"If those dynamics should lead this ""transitory"" inflation to continue too long, it could affect the planning of households and businesses and unanchor their inflation expectations.",LABEL_0,0.7241489887237549
55,This could spark a wage-price spiral that would not settle down even when the logistical bottlenecks and supply chain kinks have eased.,LABEL_0,0.9950992465019226
56,"I am among those who see a good chance that inflation will remain above 2 percent next year, but I am not quite ready to conclude that this ""transitory"" period is already ""too long.""",LABEL_1,0.9774578809738159
57,"Let me quote from the latest FOMC statement: Raising rates will not be appropriate ""until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",LABEL_1,0.9782680869102478
58,"""4 Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented reopening of the world economy.",LABEL_1,0.9985705614089966
59,"Therefore, we will remain outcome based, waiting to see further improvements in employment and the evolution of inflation pressures in coming months.",LABEL_0,0.9360707998275757
60,"And, if the broadly held expectation that inflation will recede next year turns out to be wrong or if inflation expectations show signs of becoming unanchored to the upside, I am confident that the monetary policy tools at our disposal can bring inflation down toward our 2 percent goal.",LABEL_0,0.5177077651023865
61,"I am also keenly aware, however, that inflation of 4 percent or more certainly cannot be characterized as only ""moderately"" above 2 percent, and thus we also have to deal with the question of ""How high is too high?""",LABEL_2,0.998795747756958
62,"Moreover, the two questions are obviously related: we can tolerate inflation of 2.5 percent as supply returns to normal without dramatically affecting inflation expectations, for a much longer period than we can tolerate inflation of 4.5 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9993034601211548
63,"In 2012, the FOMC formally adopted a longer-run inflation target of 2 percent, and since then, that target has been reaffirmed annually by the Committee including in our new framework adopted in August 2020.5 The key innovations in the new framework relative to the previous incarnation are designed primarily to address the risk that inflation and inflation expectations could settle below our 2 percent target.",LABEL_1,0.9992473125457764
64,That risk emanates from the understanding that several longer-run changes in the U.S. economy may have conspired to reduce the level of the equilibrium federal funds rateâ€”the level at which it is neither slowing nor speeding up economic activity.,LABEL_1,0.9489548206329346
65,"In turn, a lower average level of interest rates would make it more difficult, on balance, for the Federal Reserve to respond to negative shocks to the economy with sizable cuts to interest rates.",LABEL_2,0.9967798590660095
66,The inability to cut interest rates sufficiently can then reinforce downward pressures on inflation such that it begins to run persistently below the FOMC's 2 percent goal and causes inflation expectations to fall with it.,LABEL_0,0.9546906352043152
67,"As is well known by now, those revisions to the Fed's monetary policy framework put new emphasis on reaching maximum employment and introduced new flexibility in how to account for progress toward our price-stability goal by seeking inflation that averages 2 percent over time to ensure longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored at this level.",LABEL_1,0.9956609606742859
68,"This revision implies that monetary policy will provide more support for economic activity over a typical business cycle than had been the case, in order to prevent longer-term inflation expectationsâ€”and, ultimately, inflation itselfâ€”from settling below 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.9962769150733948
69,"In this low interest rate environment, some researchers have suggested going further than our current framework does in allowing inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time following periods where it has run persistently lower than 2 percent, and actually raising the inflation target to 2.5 percent or 3 percent or even 4 percent.6 At the outset of our recently completed review, we reaffirmed that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate for price stability.7 I believe that any future discussion of a higher target would need to address whether it remained consistent with that congressional mandate.",LABEL_0,0.9858412742614746
70,"I would also emphasize that at this point, the public is very accustomed to a world of inflation near 2 percent, which has allowed households and businesses to operate with considerable certainty.",LABEL_0,0.5663419961929321
71,"Research shows that such certainty is valuable for households and businesses to make sound financial decisions and to avoid economic distortions that could hinder economic growth.8 My strong support for our consensus framework is predicated not only upon its new features designed to address inflation that falls too low, but also its commitment to prevent longer-term inflation expectations from rising materially above a level consistent with our 2 percent goal.",LABEL_1,0.995408833026886
72,"In this sense, the current elevated rates of inflation are not challenging our new framework any more than they would have challenged our previous framework or, for that matter, most reasonable frameworks for conducting monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.8861657381057739
73,"As I said earlier, when our price-stability and employment goals are not complementary, the framework calls for policy to depend on the remaining shortfall from our maximum-employment goal, on the extent to which inflation continues to exceed 2 percent, and on the amount of time we expect it will take for employment and inflation to meet our goals.",LABEL_2,0.9986764788627625
74,But that forecast for growth and uncertainty about the resolution of supply constraints mean that there are upside risks to inflation next year.,LABEL_1,0.9940552711486816
75,"So my focus is beginning to turn more fully from the rapidly improving labor market to whether inflation begins its descent toward levels that are more consistent with our price-stability mandate, as most forecasters and most of my colleagues on the FOMC expect over the next year.",LABEL_1,0.9923298954963684
