26,"The first was that I believe that a determined central bank could and should work to eliminate deflation—that is, falling prices.",LABEL_0,0.9982775449752808

31,"We have—we, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation, which has proved extremely valuable in that we’ve been be able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four or five years to support the economy without leading to an unanchoring of inflation expectations or a destabilization of inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9891245365142822

47,"There’s some disagreement, I think, about exactly how balance sheet actions by the Federal Reserve affect Treasury yields and other asset prices.",LABEL_1,0.7301928997039795
48,"The view that we have generally taken at the Fed, in which I think—for which I think the evidence is pretty good, is that it’s the quantity of securities held by the Fed at a given time rather than the new purchases—the flow of new purchases—which is the primary determinant of interest rates.",LABEL_2,0.9997349381446838
49,"And if that theory is correct, then at such time that our purchases come to an end, there should be relatively minimal effects on interest rates at that time.",LABEL_2,0.9995673298835754
50,And we need to continue to maintain a strong monetary policy support to make sure that the economy continues on a recovery path and returns to a more normal situation.,LABEL_2,0.9995222091674805
51,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.,LABEL_0,0.7906057238578796
52,"As for the bond bubble, interest rates are low for a lot of reasons; they include monetary policy, of course, but they also include a weak economy, low inflation expectations, and safe-haven demands for U.S. Treasuries.",LABEL_0,0.9859606027603149
53,"So, of course, interest rates will rise at some point.",LABEL_0,0.9943464398384094

55,"Actually, we had a very good discussion of that at the meeting because it is an important issue, trying to assess how much of the change in employment is structural, how much is cyclical, and so on.",LABEL_0,0.9954374432563782
56,"Much of it is young people, for example, who presumably are not out of the labor force indefinitely, but, given the weak job market, they are going to school or doing something else rather than working.",LABEL_1,0.9949951171875
57,"So one possibility and one reason why the unemployment rate may not fall as quickly going forward is that as the economy strengthens, as the labor market strengthens, many of these folks are going to come back in the labor force looking for work, which I think would be a good thing.",LABEL_0,0.9988545179367065
58,"April 25, 2012 Chairman Bernanke’s Press Conference I advanced the hypothesis that the increase in employment we’ve seen in the last five, six FINAL months might to some extent be greater than we’d expect going forward because it represented a one-time catch-up, undoing the very sharp layoffs in 2008 and 2009.",LABEL_2,0.9997811913490295
59,"If unemployment looks like it’s no longer making progress, that’ll be an important consideration in thinking about policy options.",LABEL_0,0.9846760630607605
60,"We need fewer jobs monthly to keep unemployment consistent or stable than in the past—I suppose more like 100,000 a month for stability.",LABEL_0,0.9850901365280151
