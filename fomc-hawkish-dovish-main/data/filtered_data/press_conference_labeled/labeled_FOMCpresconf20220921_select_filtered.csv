64,"Well, so, again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive—and by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation.",LABEL_1,0.7967996001243591
65,"We also know that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation.",LABEL_0,0.9758632183074951
66,"And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we’re writing down and think about—you measure those against some sort of forward-looking assessment of inflation, inflation expectations.",LABEL_1,0.9983139038085938
67,"So, what we’ve seen is, inflation has—our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply-side healing.",LABEL_1,0.9993394017219543
68,"We have seen some supply-side healing, but inflation has not really come down.",LABEL_2,0.9939805269241333

80,"We’re forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are.",LABEL_2,0.9996997117996216
81,But you’re right—there’s certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that.,LABEL_1,0.9414921998977661

84,"So the median forecast, I think, this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth.",LABEL_0,0.9977521300315857
85,So that’s very slow growth.,LABEL_0,0.9633281826972961

97,"I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down.",LABEL_1,0.9981781244277954
98,And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that.,LABEL_0,0.9822863936424255
