21,The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9994290471076965
22,"So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis.",LABEL_2,0.9997112154960632
23,I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation—actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.,LABEL_1,0.9837297797203064
24,So we say in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.,LABEL_0,0.9467421770095825
25,"And I’d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things.",LABEL_1,0.9419872164726257
26,"In addition, the May 1, 2019 trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.",LABEL_2,0.9998321533203125
27,"But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent—inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy.",LABEL_2,0.9990867376327515
28,"That’s just good monetary policy, good monetary control.",LABEL_0,0.9952765703201294
29,"But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices.",LABEL_2,0.6001371145248413
30,"And as for asset prices, some asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so.",LABEL_2,0.9998239874839783
31,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.,LABEL_1,0.9359845519065857
32,Those are better first-order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9997480511665344
33,"So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there.",LABEL_2,0.9998146891593933
34,And so I think the expectation was that inflation would remain up around 2 percent.,LABEL_2,0.7520648241043091

36,I do think it’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably —for a sustained period of time—and symmetrically around 2 percent.,LABEL_2,0.9348450899124146
37,"Because if it doesn’t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times.",LABEL_2,0.8726065158843994

40,"And, again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up.",LABEL_2,0.9998154044151306
41,Growth is at a healthy level.,LABEL_2,0.9791097640991211

43,"This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it’s very interesting to look at the history.",LABEL_0,0.8537560105323792
44,"And what we’re always solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9991503953933716
45,"We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy.",LABEL_1,0.951749861240387
46,"And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision, after an extensive discussion, that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is.",LABEL_2,0.9998527765274048
47,"And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we’re going to be patient as we consider adjustments.",LABEL_2,0.9978519678115845
48,"So you’re pointing to, really, the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below.",LABEL_2,0.9986466765403748
49,"And it’s just a question, I think, of demographic Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent, and it creates significant challenges.",LABEL_0,0.992326021194458
50,"One, I would say, is, it means that interest rates will be lower—will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because that means lower interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9980717301368713
51,"And that’s one of the reasons we’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year—to think about that problem.",LABEL_0,0.992906928062439
52,"Yes, we see that reading as—it’s still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth.",LABEL_2,0.9997051358222961
53,"So it’s—yes, it’s something that we are watching carefully, but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector.",LABEL_2,0.9987032413482666
54,"Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U.S. economy for growth for the rest of this year.",LABEL_2,0.9995681643486023
55,"And, as I mentioned, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending—that’s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up.",LABEL_1,0.8699971437454224
56,"Let me say, I don’t mean to diminish concerns about too-low inflation, but I think there’s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors.",LABEL_1,0.9979863166809082
57,"One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag.",LABEL_2,0.5269673466682434
58,"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.",LABEL_2,0.9989983439445496
59,"Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel, and apparel prices were very, very low.",LABEL_2,0.9991581439971924
60,"And another way to look at it is, there are models that look at inflation in different ways, like—not models, but measures, like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned.",LABEL_2,0.9996540546417236
61,"So trimmed mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories, and it didn’t go down at all.",LABEL_2,0.9998334646224976
62,"Many of you will remember, in March of 2017, there was a May 1, 2019 very low reading for cell phone services—mobile phone services—and it was kind of a price Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year, but it did not look like something that would be repeated.",LABEL_2,0.999629020690918
63,"And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9941997528076172
64,"We’re going to be watching—really, I’d like to say we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that these things are transient, and I’ll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective.",LABEL_2,0.6417019963264465
65,"Stable prices is half of our mandate, and we’ve defined that as 2 percent.",LABEL_2,0.9993911981582642
66,"I mean, we’re—with—the balance sheet is now—the size of it is going to be driven by demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned.",LABEL_0,0.513266921043396
67,And we’re right at that point where we’re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next few months.,LABEL_2,0.9997109770774841
68,"We see inflation below 2 percent now—as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year.",LABEL_2,0.9997413754463196
69,"Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate, given inflation and given productivity, but not at all signaling any overheating at all.",LABEL_0,0.9787539839744568
70,It’s not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity.,LABEL_1,0.7465568780899048
71,You mentioned productivity.,LABEL_2,0.999836802482605
72,So productivity is really very difficult to predict.,LABEL_2,0.9989332556724548
73,"But I will say this: Productivity was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years.",LABEL_2,0.9998160004615784
74,"Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher.",LABEL_0,0.9637640118598938
