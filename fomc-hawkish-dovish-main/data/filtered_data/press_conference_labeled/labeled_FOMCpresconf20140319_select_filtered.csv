19,Today the FOMC also updated its forward guidance regarding the path of short-term interest rates.,LABEL_2,0.9995631575584412
20,"In December 2012, the Committee first stated its guidance in terms of economic thresholds, stipulating that the current low range for the federal funds rate target would be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above our longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.",LABEL_2,0.9988429546356201
21,"Since that time, progress in the labor market has been more rapid than we had anticipated, while inflation has been lower than the Committee had expected.",LABEL_0,0.945259153842926
22,"Although the thresholds served well as a useful guide to policy over the past year, last December the FOMC judged it appropriate to update that guidance, noting that the current target range for the federal funds rate would likely be maintained “well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.” Today the Committee has further revised its forward guidance to better reflect conditions as they now stand and are likely to evolve over coming quarters.",LABEL_0,0.9985355138778687
23,The revised formulation starts with a general description of the factors that drive FOMC decisionmaking and then provides the FOMC’s current assessment of what those factors will likely imply for the future path of short-term interest rates.,LABEL_0,0.5536537766456604
24,"In particular, the Committee states that “[i]n determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, it [the Committee] will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.” In short, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from the respective objectives set by the FOMC, and the longer any such shortfall is expected to persist, the longer the target federal funds rate is likely to remain in the present 0 to ¼ percent range.",LABEL_2,0.9997842907905579
25,"The FOMC will base its ongoing assessment on a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.",LABEL_0,0.9611387848854065
26,"The Committee continues to anticipate that conditions will likely warrant maintaining “the current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.” The FOMC also supplemented its guidance pertaining to the period after the asset purchase program ends and the initial increase in the federal funds rate target has occurred.",LABEL_2,0.9996824264526367
27,"The statement now adds the Committee’s current anticipation that “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping” short-term interest rates “below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections, which show the federal funds rate for most participants remaining well below longer-run normal values at the end of 2016.",LABEL_0,0.9843669533729553
28,"Although FOMC participants provide a number of explanations for the federal funds rate target remaining below its longer-run normal level, many cite the residual impacts of the financial crisis, and some note that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower, at least for a time.",LABEL_0,0.999037504196167
29,"In summary, the Committee’s actions today reflect its assessment that progress in the labor market is continuing, but that much remains to be done on both the jobs and inflation fronts.",LABEL_0,0.9993489384651184
30,"Unemployment is still elevated, underemployment and long-term unemployment remain significant concerns, and inflation is running significantly below the FOMC’s objective.",LABEL_2,0.9925423860549927
31,"The Federal Reserve’s interest rate guidance and its substantial and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, promoting the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.",LABEL_0,0.9994593262672424
32,"But it is becoming—as the unemployment rate gets closer and closer to 6½ percent, to breaching that threshold that seems like the one that is likely to be breached.",LABEL_0,0.998725950717926
33,"So the purpose of this change is simply to provide more information than we have in the past, even though it is qualitative information, about what we will be looking at as the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent in deciding how long to hold the federal funds rate at this 0 to ¼ percent range.",LABEL_0,0.990559995174408
34,We initially started with an unemployment rate as a threshold.,LABEL_2,0.9994816184043884
35,"That was easy enough for the Committee to say, “With an unemployment rate above 6½ percent, we know we’re not close to full employment, not close to an employment level consistent with our mandate, and unless inflation were a significant concern, we wouldn’t dream of raising the federal funds rate target.” Now, the Committee has never felt that the unemployment rate is a sufficient statistic for the labor market.",LABEL_2,0.9995622038841248
36,"I think if I had to choose one indicator of the labor market, the unemployment rate is probably as good a one as I could find.",LABEL_0,0.9978285431861877
37,But in assessing the real state of slack in the labor market and ultimately of inflationary pressures that might—or deflationary pressures that could result from that—it’s appropriate to look at many more things.,LABEL_2,0.9997219443321228

39,"And I will simply say on my own behalf, and on behalf of the Committee, that we are fully committed to the 2 percent inflation objective, and we do not want to undershoot inflation for a prolonged period of time.",LABEL_0,0.9748700857162476
40,"As I mentioned, monetary policy operates with lags, so, the policies we have in place, we think, will gradually—only gradually—move inflation back to 2 percent.",LABEL_0,0.99089115858078
41,"But if the Committee had real concerns that inflation were going to remain persistently below 2 percent, I feel confident that the Committee would act to prevent that.",LABEL_1,0.9986321330070496

43,"The labor market more broadly, I think, has improved a little more than we might have expected, and that slightly more rapid improvement in the unemployment picture might explain—I can’t speak for why people write down what they do, but—a little bit of the upward shift in those dots.",LABEL_0,0.9795398712158203
44,"Looking further out, let’s say if you look toward the end of 2016 when most participants are projecting that the employment situation—that the unemployment rate will be close to their notions of mandate-consistent or longer-run normal levels.",LABEL_1,0.788770318031311
45,"Monetary policy will be geared to evolving conditions in the economy, and the public does need to understand that as those views evolve, the Committee’s views on policy will likely evolve with them.",LABEL_2,0.9994902610778809
46,"Yes, I think it does suggest a shallower glide path, and what the Committee is expressing here, I would say, is its forecast of what will be appropriate some years from now based on its—the understanding that we’ve developed about what are the economic forces that have been driving economic activity.",LABEL_2,0.9996739625930786
47,We’ve had a series of years now in which growth has proven disappointing.,LABEL_2,0.7924808859825134
48,"Now, members of the Committee have different views about why this is likely to be true, that the funds rate—when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to our objective—they maybe have slightly different views on exactly why it’s likely to be the case that interest rates will be a little lower than they would in the longer run.",LABEL_0,0.8670598268508911
49,"But the general assessment is that even after we’ve had an accommodative monetary policy for long enough to get the economy back on track in the sense of meeting our objectives, the stance of policy that will be appropriate to accomplish that will be easier or involve somewhat lower than would be normal short-term interest rates.",LABEL_0,0.9980104565620422
50,"So, I’d say, certainly the analysis that we’ve done—and we did spend a lot of time discussing weather and how it’s affected businesses and households in various parts of the country—certainly weather has played an important role in weakening economic activity in Q1.",LABEL_0,0.9939568042755127
51,"It’s not the only factor that is at work, and most projections for growth in the first quarter are reasonably weak.",LABEL_0,0.954138994216919
52,"So, I’d say so far we haven’t had that tradeoff to make because inflation is running well below our objective, and by any measure there remains substantial slack in the labor market.",LABEL_0,0.9972288012504578
53,"As we get closer to meeting our goals, it could become an element, and I would say that we’ve given guidance in the statement—and we gave perhaps more guidance in our so-called consensus statement or statement of longer-run goals and monetary policy strategies that we’ve now reaffirmed for three years in a row—that the Committee would take a balanced approach in situations where our objectives conflict and we’re faced with tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment.",LABEL_0,0.9980953335762024
54,"When we first put our thresholds into effect, we envisioned a possible situation where such a tradeoff could arise, where we might face a situation where unemployment was quite high—namely, over 6½ percent—and inflation might be drifting close to 2 or even a little bit above 2.",LABEL_2,0.9995775818824768
55,And our threshold-based guidance gave some more concrete indication that we would tolerate inflation running a little bit over 2 percent with unemployment sufficiently high before moving the federal funds rate off zero.,LABEL_2,0.9342376589775085
56,"But I would point you to the statement—the final statement in this statement that says that the FOMC does not see this guidance as indicating any change in our policy intentions, and I would include how we would make tradeoffs between our inflation and employment objectives if we were to face that situation.",LABEL_1,0.995884120464325
