13,"Because monetary policy does not determine the maximum level of employment that the economy can sustain in the longer term, and since many of the determinants of maximum employment may change over time or may not be directly measurable, it is not feasible for any central bank to specify a fixed goal for the longer-run level of employment.",LABEL_2,0.9995192289352417

63,"So I think what we need to do, as is often the case when the economy goes into a very weak situation, then low interest rates are needed to help restore the economy to something closer to full employment and to increase growth and that, in turn, will lead ultimately to higher returns across all assets for savers and investors.",LABEL_1,0.9892219305038452

68,"The weakness of the housing sector is an important reason why the economy is not recovering more robustly, and the problems in housing finance are part of the reason why monetary policy has not been more powerful—because part of our transmission mechanism is through lower interest rates, which affects refinancing; it affects sales and purchases as well.",LABEL_0,0.8571943640708923

70,"So, a literal reading of price stability would say inflation should be at zero.",LABEL_0,0.9977872371673584
71,There are probably some measurement biases and other issues that mean that a measured value of inflation above zero is probably consistent with stable prices.,LABEL_2,0.9995927214622498
72,"But as we’ve talked about frequently, we set inflation—our inflation objective in a way that was consistent with both sides of the mandate: price stability—and 2 percent is low enough that we believe that it’s not going to extensively interfere with financial planning and economic planning on the part of households and businesses—but also in the interest of employment.",LABEL_2,0.9960105419158936
73,A target for inflation that was zero would have several consequences.,LABEL_2,0.9992504715919495

75,"Incidentally, related to that, a zero inflation rate would mean that nominal interest rates would be at very low levels, typically 2 to 3 percent or whatever they might be, and that would increase the risk and probability that we would be in a situation like today where we really can’t cut the short-term interest rate any further.",LABEL_2,0.9849855899810791
