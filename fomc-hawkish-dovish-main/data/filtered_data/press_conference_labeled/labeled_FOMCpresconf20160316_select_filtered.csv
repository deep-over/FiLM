43,We did take note in the statement of the fact that inflation has picked up in recent months.,LABEL_1,0.9990636706352234
44,I see some of that as having to do with unusually high inflation readings in categories that tend to be quite volatile without very much significance for inflation over time.,LABEL_2,0.9815882444381714

46,"But we note—the Committee notes, as it did in December, that we continue to monitor development trends and developments closely, and that would include both the fact that recent inflation readings have been on the high side, and, as I mentioned, on the other side, that readings on measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures have been on the low side.",LABEL_0,0.8760600686073303
47,"So, in that sense, there are risks around the inflation forecast in both—in both directions.",LABEL_2,0.999134361743927

60,"Our neighbors both to the north and south, Canada and Mexico, are feeling the impacts of lower oil prices on their growth.",LABEL_0,0.9752405881881714

62,"We have six weeks, but there will be additional data on the labor market and on various factors that pertain to inflation.",LABEL_2,0.999822199344635
63,So let me start with the impact of oil prices on consumer spending.,LABEL_2,0.9997264742851257
64,"I have to say, it’s very difficult when you look at patterns of consumer spending to—there are many factors that influence it, and to definitively say that lower oil prices have not boosted consumer spending, I’m not sure we can really arrive at that conclusion in any—in any rigorous way.",LABEL_2,0.9985060691833496
65,"The typical—the average household in the United States with oil prices where they are now is probably benefiting around $1,000 a year.",LABEL_2,0.7741422057151794
66,"And, of course, on the other side, we are—and, you know, it may be that it will take a while, and it’s something that will slowly strengthen over time if oil prices stay low.",LABEL_0,0.8527680039405823
67,"With respect to impact of oil prices on inflation and what would happen if they move up, the Committee has generally tended to look through movements in oil prices, whether they were on the upside or on the downside, viewing it as a factor that should have a transitory influence.",LABEL_2,0.9998214840888977
68,"And when I say that, what I mean is that if oil prices move up during the time that it’s moving up, it raises inflation.",LABEL_1,0.9991922974586487
69,"And, similarly, oil prices have obviously moved down a great deal over the last year, and we’re not expecting them to move back to their previous levels but to stabilize at some level.",LABEL_2,0.9712793827056885
70,"They’re obviously volatile, but, as they stabilize, the influence will move out of both headline—of headline inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9997921586036682
71,"So if oil prices were to increase to 50, I mean, that would probably slightly move up our expected path for core inflation, maybe speed how rapidly we would move back to 2 percent, but I wouldn’t think that that would be something alone that would have great policy significance.",LABEL_2,0.9953587651252747
72,"First of all, the U.S. economy has been very resilient in recent months in the face of shocks, and we highlighted that right at the beginning of our statement, where we said that “economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months.” And that—that is important, that the U.S. economy continues to do well.",LABEL_1,0.9556185603141785

74,"And, at the same time, low oil prices continue to boost household purchasing power.",LABEL_0,0.8383696675300598

76,"But in the aggregate data, one doesn’t yet see any convincing evidence of a pickup in wage growth.",LABEL_2,0.6042333245277405
77,"So I do think, consistent with the 2 percent inflation objective, that there is certainly scope for further increases in wages.",LABEL_1,0.9990898370742798
78,"The fact that we have not seen any broad-based pickup is one of the factors that suggests to me that there is continued slack in the labor market, but I would expect wage growth to move up some.",LABEL_0,0.9838809967041016
79,Gains in inflation-adjusted disposable income are running at a healthy pace.,LABEL_1,0.9992357492446899
80,"As I mentioned, households have benefited pretty significantly from lower oil prices, and measures of consumer sentiment do reflect—do reflect that.",LABEL_0,0.9929469227790833
81,So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.,LABEL_2,0.9998464584350586
82,"In—in a world with highly integrated capital markets, monetary policy actions in any country have effects—spillovers to other countries.",LABEL_2,0.9997195601463318
83,"That’s true of our monetary policy, and it’s true of other countries’ monetary policies.",LABEL_2,0.9998551607131958
84,"In part, that shows up through movements in exchange rates, and those movements are a factor that any country needs to take into account in deciding what is the appropriate stance of monetary policy.",LABEL_2,0.9997738003730774
85,So the fact that there are these linkages is an important factor in designing a monetary policy.,LABEL_2,0.9997994303703308
86,monetary policy is somehow constrained in a way that makes it impossible for our monetary policy to diverge from policies abroad.,LABEL_2,0.9996190071105957
87,Movements in exchange rates partly reflect that.,LABEL_2,0.9997979998588562
88,So I should point out that I think what you’re talking about is the slight decline in the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.,LABEL_0,0.9949204325675964
89,"That, and the slope of the path of rate increases combined with projections of relatively low inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9761812090873718
90,So I—the path of rate increases maybe slightly reflects the modest decline in estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.,LABEL_1,0.9968481659889221
91,"It’s also, as I mentioned, a reflection of shifts in other views about, for example, the likely pace of global growth that affects what we need, as a policy path, to achieve our objectives.",LABEL_2,0.9998102784156799
92,"But the slow pace of wage growth, the fact that part-time employment for economic reasons and voluntary part-time employment remains high—we have seen an upward move in labor force participation, which is heartening and suggests that there was scope there for further improvement in the labor market.",LABEL_0,0.9987284541130066
93,My guess is that those things influenced individuals who wrote down a slightly lower number for the longer-run unemployment rate.,LABEL_2,0.997467041015625
94,"So the Phillips curve posits that there is a relationship between the degree of slack in the labor market and inflation, and it is an empirical relationship that, while not absolutely tight, has been a consistent relationship over time, and I believe that relationship still holds.",LABEL_2,0.9987797141075134
95,But the impact of shifts in the unemployment rate on inflation should not be overstated.,LABEL_2,0.9997575879096985
96,"The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in unemployment have only a modest impact on inflation, so we shouldn’t overblow how large that is.",LABEL_2,0.9998112320899963
97,"In addition, the Phillips curve theory suggests that inflation expectations are also an important driver of actual wage- and price-setting decisions and inflation behavior, and I believe there’s also solid empirical evidence for that.",LABEL_2,0.9996300935745239
98,"And it’s one of the reasons that I highlighted in my statement, and we continue to highlight in the FOMC statement, that we are tracking indicators of the inflation expectations that matter to wage and price setting.",LABEL_2,0.9993492960929871

101,Inflation compensation as measured in financial markets also embodies a variety of risk premia and liquidity premia.,LABEL_2,0.9997686743736267
102,"And so, it’s also—we monitor those closely and discuss them in the statement in paragraph one, but, again, there’s not a straight read on what’s happening to the expectations that influence wage and price setting.",LABEL_2,0.9997336268424988
