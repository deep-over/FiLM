27,The implications of continued robust growth for the inflation outlook depended critically on judgments about the supply side of the economy.,LABEL_1,0.9996789693832397
28,That acceleration had itself tended to boost consumption and investment demand--in complex interactions of aggregate supply and demand--but it also had held down increases in unit costs and prices.,LABEL_1,0.9985052347183228
29,"A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the behavior of productivity growth going forward, but some further pickup, and the associated ability of the economy to accommodate more rapid growth without added inflation, was a possibility that could not be overlooked.",LABEL_1,0.956628143787384

50,Other factors cited as pointing to a less benign inflation performance involved the waning or reversal of a number of temporary influences that had exerted a beneficial effect on prices in recent years.,LABEL_1,0.9940899014472961
51,"In particular, the decline of the dollar from its recent high in July, especially if it were to continue, would mean higher import prices and reduced price competition for a wide range of domestic goods.",LABEL_2,0.7810297608375549

59,"It was noted that expanding aggregate supply, boosted by accelerating productivity, had remained in reasonable balance with rapidly growing aggregate demand despite an already high level of economic activity; however, substantial uncertainty surrounded the outlook for aggregate supply and aggregate demand going forward and it was unclear how their interaction would affect the behavior of inflation.",LABEL_2,0.9984195232391357
60,"In light of the uncertainties surrounding these developments, the members agreed that it would be desirable to await more evidence on the performance of the economy, and in this regard considerable new information on the behavior of the economy and the outlook for inflation would become available during the intermeeting period.",LABEL_1,0.773192822933197
61,"The risks of waiting seemed small at this juncture, in part because inflation and inflation expectations were not likely to worsen substantially in the near term, and the Committee had demonstrated its willingness to take needed anticipatory action to curb rising inflationary pressures that could threaten the overall performance of the economy.",LABEL_1,0.999118983745575
62,"They also believed that, given the Committee's recently adopted practice of immediately announcing its decisions to change the symmetry of the directive, an asymmetrical directive would help convey the message that policy adjustments might not yet be completed for the balance of this year and that the Committee remained concerned about potential inflationary developments in coming months.",LABEL_1,0.999016284942627
