56,Such increases in productivity along with slack in foreign economies contributed to the very strong competition in most markets that was continuing generally to suppress efforts to raise prices.,LABEL_2,0.9994162321090698

70,"Accordingly, they agreed that those ranges should not reflect or be centered on forecasts of money growth under projected economic and financial conditions, but should be regarded as anchors or benchmarks for money growth that would be associated with approximate price stability and sustained economic expansion, assuming behavior of velocity in line with historical experience.",LABEL_1,0.9994128942489624
71,A reaffirmation of those ranges for 1999 and their extension to 2000 would therefore underscore the Committee's commitment to achieving and maintaining price stability over time and thereby fostering maximum sustainable economic growth.,LABEL_1,0.9985467791557312

84,"While current indications of accelerating inflation were quite limited, the economy had been expanding rapidly enough to put added pressure on labor markets over time, and many members expressed growing concern that, given the current stance of monetary policy, the persisting strength of domestic demand augmented by increasing demand from abroad would show through at some point to even tighter labor markets and higher inflation, which would impinge over time on the economy's ability to realize its full growth potential.",LABEL_2,0.7766503095626831
