1,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",HAWKISH - The sentence emphasizes the importance of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent and the challenge of doing so in a world where the effective-lower-bound constraint is binding on the federal funds rate. The statement also conveys the Committee's judgment that policy will be conducted to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability.
