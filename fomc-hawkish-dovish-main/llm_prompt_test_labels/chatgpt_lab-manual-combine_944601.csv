This implies that the economy is not yet fully recovered and may require further monetary policy easing to support growth."
1,"Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.","HAWKISH
